abstract = {This paper gives an overview of medium-voltage (MV) multilevel converters with a focus on achieving minimum harmonic distortion and high efficiency at low switching frequency operation. Increasing the power rating by minimizing switching frequency while still maintaining reasonable power quality is an important requirement and a persistent challenge for the industry. Existing solutions are discussed and analyzed based on their topologies, limitations, and control techniques. As a preferred option for future research and application, an inverter configuration based on three-level building blocks to generate five-level voltage waveforms is suggested. This paper shows that such an inverter may be operated at a very low switching frequency to achieve minimum on-state and dynamic device losses for highly efficient MV drive applications while maintaining low harmonic distortion.},

Therefore, this paper considers an emerging hybrid cascaded converter that offers the dc side short circuit proof feature at reduced loss and footprint compared to the existing multilevel and other hybrid converters. Its operating principle, modulation and capacitor voltage balancing strategies are described in detail. Furthermore, hybrid converter scalability to high voltage applications is investigated. The validity of the modulation and capacitor voltage strategy presented are confirmed using simulation and experimentation. The hybrid cascaded converter is extendable to a large number of cells, making it applicable to high voltage applications, and operation is independent of modulation index and power factor. On these ground, the converter is expected to be applicable for both real and reactive power applications.},

The presented control strategy permits operation with reduced dc link voltage during permanent pole-to-ground dc fault, and controlled discharge and recharge of the HVDC links during shutdown and restart following clearance of temporary pole-to-pole dc faults. Additionally, it allows voltage source converter based HVDC links that employ FB-MMC to be operated with both positive and negative dc negative dc link voltages. This feature is well suited for hybrid HVDC networks, where the voltage source converters are operated alongside the line commutating current source converters, without any compromise to the power reversal at any terminals. The usefulness of the presented control strategy is demonstrated on full-scale model of HVDC link that uses FB-MMC with 101 cells per arm, considering the cases of pole-to-ground and pole-to-pole dc faults.},

The models include the high frequency parasitic components in the circuit and enable very fast, accurate simulation of the switching behaviour of SiC MOSFET using only datasheet parameters. The much higher switching speed of SiC devices over Si counterparts necessitates a clear detailed analysis. Each switching transient was divided into four distinct sub-periods and their respective equivalent circuits were solved to approximate the circuit state variables. Nonlinearities in the junction capacitances of SiC devices were considered in the model. Analytical modelling results were close to the LTspice simulation results with a threefold reduction in the simulation time. The effect of snubber capacitors on the soft-switching waveforms is also explained analytically and validated experimentally, which enables the analytical model to be used to evaluate future soft-switching solutions. It was found that the snubber branch can significantly reduce the turn off ringing of the SiC MOSFET in addition to the reduction of switching losses.},

abstract = {The feasibility of future multiterminal dc (MTDC) systems depends largely on the capability to withstand dcside faults. Simulation models of MTDC systems play a very important role in investigating these faults. For such studies the test system needs to be accurate and computationally efficient. This paper proposes a detailed equivalent model (DEM) of the modular multilevel converter (MMC), which is used to develop the MTDC test system. The proposed model is capable of representing the blocked-mode operation of the MMC, and can be used to study the balancing control of the capacitor voltages. Additionally, the operation of the MMC when redundant submodules are included in the arms can also be studied. A simplified model of a hybrid high-voltage dc (HVDC) breaker is also developed. Hence, the developed test system is capable of accurately describing the behavior of the MMC-based MTDC system employing hybrid HVDC breakers, during fault conditions. Using time-domain simulations, permanent dc-side faults are studied in the MTDC system. Additionally, a scheme to control the fault current through the MMC using thyristors on the ac-side of the converter is proposed.},

Selection of the appropriate surge arresters requires a comprehensive understanding of the phenomena that cause the overvoltages and accurate calculation of energy discharged in the arresters. This paper investigates the mechanism that causes transient overvoltages, due to DC-side line-to-ground faults, in a cable-connected MMC-HVDC link. The paper also evaluates the impacts of various system parameters, e.g., the pre-fault power transfer level, the MMC arm inductance, the transformer leakage inductance, the fault location, the AC system short-circuit capacity, the cable inductance, and the MMC blocking delay, on the peak transient overvoltages and the amount of energy discharge in the cable surge arresters. The transient overvoltage studies are also conducted when the DC cable is replaced by an over-head line. The studies are performed in the PSCAD platform. The studies conclude that the pre-fault power transfer level and the MMC blocking delay have the most significant impacts on the surge arrester energy discharge under DC-side line-to-ground faults in the MMC-HVDC link. The study results also provide essential information for the design of the MMC-HVDC link components.},

Each converter cell consists of a bidirectional isolated medium-frequency dc/dc converter and two voltage-source H-bridge (single-phase full-bridge) PWM converters. Extremely low-voltage steps bring a significant reduction in harmonics and electromagnetic interference emissions to the BTB system. This paper designs, constructs, and tests a single-phase downscaled BTB system rated at 120 V and 3.3 kW to verify the viability and effectiveness, leading to the actual system.},

However, projections are that world demand for materials will DOUBLE by 2050, so to meet our emissions target, we have to achieve a 4-fold reduction in emissions per unit of material used. The book presents a vision for change, backed by comprehensive real life experience. The book is based on scientific detail. But it's practical, not pie in the sky: everything in the book is backed by evidence and commercial experience. The solutions presented here are ahead of the game now. By providing an evidence-based vision of change, the book can play a significant role in influencing our future. The book is written for a popular audience as well as specialists, and is beautifully produced with full colour throughout. Professional readers it will appeal to include: technical, and business managers; and NGO officials associated with business, climate, energy, environment, waste, trade and financing. The book is relevant to a wide range of industries: energy industry; the steel and aluminium industries; mining; construction; consulting; manufacturing; architecture. For readers who don't believe that carbon emissions matter, the same arguments apply to energy saving: this book is not about climate change - it's about using materials wisely, and getting more for less.},

To stay within the maximum current, reached only during transients, the system is typically overrated. Active thermal management is used to control the maximum temperature and the temperature swing to reduce failures that are mostly caused by them. In this paper it is proposed to use the active thermal management to reduce the switching losses or to move them to less stressed devices, during transients, such as a module can reach an higher current, without violating thermal constraints, and the need of overdesign can be reduced. Hence an optimal and cost effective design of power electronics system is achieved.},

abstract = {Variable-speed drives have reduced voltage requirements when operating below the base speed. In a modular-multilevel-converter-based (M2C-based) motor drive, it is then possible to operate with reduced voltage in the submodule capacitors, than at the base speed. In this sense, a greater capacitor-voltage ripple can be accommodated, without exceeding the maximum peak-capacitor voltage. This paper presents an analytical investigation for the optimal selection of the average capacitor voltage for M2Cs, when the motor is operating with rated torque, below the base speed. This method does not require any power exchange between the converter arms, so it keeps the conduction losses at the minimum level. Additionally, the method decreases the switching losses, due to the decreased capacitor-voltage level. The overall ratings of the converter remain the same as in the base-speed operation. It is shown that this method can be applied at a speed range between the base speed and down to approximately one third of it, i.e., an operating range that covers the requirements for typical pump- and fan-type applications. The results obtained from the analytical investigation are experimentally verified on a down-scaled laboratory prototype M2C.},

Low-distortion output quantities combined with low average switching frequencies for the semiconductor devices create an ideal combination for very high-efficiency drives. However, the large number of devices and capacitors that have to conduct the fundamental-frequency current require more complex converter control techniques than its two-level counterpart. Special care needs to be taken for starting and operation at low speeds, where the low-frequency current may cause significant unbalance between the submodule capacitor voltages and disturb the output waveforms. In this paper, principles for converter operation with high torque in the whole speed range are investigated. Experimental results from a down-scaled 12-kVA prototype converter running a loaded motor at various speeds between standstill and the rated speed are also provided.},

This strategy, using the steady-state solutions of the dynamic equations for controlling the total stored energy in each converter arm, has proven to be effective.

abstract = { This paper explores a new configuration for modular DC/DC converters, namely, series connection at the input, and parallel connection at the output, such that the converters share the input voltage and load current equally. This is an important step toward realizing a truly modular power system architecture, where low-power, low-voltage, building block modules can be connected in any series/parallel combination at input or at output, to realize any given system specifications. A three-loop control scheme, consisting of a common output voltage loop, individual inner current loops, and individual input voltage loops, is proposed to achieve input voltage and load current sharing. The output voltage loop provides the basic reference for inner current loops, which is modified by the respective input voltage loops. The average of converter input voltages, which is dynamically varying, is chosen as the reference for input voltage loops. This choice of reference eliminates interaction among different control loops. The input-series and output-parallel (ISOP) configuration is analyzed using the incremental negative resistance model of DC/DC converters. Based on the analysis, design methods for input voltage controller are developed. Analysis and proposed design methods are verified through simulation, and experimentally, on an ISOP system consisting of two forward converters.},

One of the technical challenges associated with the operation of the MMC is the circulation of doublefrequency harmonic currents within its phase-legs. This paper proposes a circulating current control strategy in a doublefrequency rotating reference frame, which contrary to the existing solutions that are based on approximate/inaccurate models, relies on an experimentally-identified nonparametric model of circulating currents to determine the coecients of the controller. Minimizing the squared second norm of the error between the open-loop transfer function of the system and a desired one, the coecients of the controller are determined. To guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system, the minimization problem is subjected to a few constraints. The validity and eectiveness of the proposed control strategy is confirmed, and its dynamic performance is compared with that of an existing solution by experimental results.},

abstract = {The design of a modular power converter based on medium frequency AC-Link for offshore wind turbines regarding efficiency, power density and power to mass ratio is described in this paper. The impact of four design parameters in the three objectives is studied. Such parameters are the AC-AC converter topology, the number of modules, and the number of phases and frequency of the AC-link. Six topologies are investigated and compared. The conventional back-to-back (B2B) converter, the B2B with three phase squared wave output, the B2B with single phase squared wave output, the direct matrix converter, the indirect matrix converter, and the reduced matrix converter are the selected topologies. The Pareto surface of the three objectives is obtained for a set of design parameters. It has been found that a wind energy conversion system based on a medium frequency AC-link will lead the best trade-off between efficiency, power density and power to mass ratio when the AC-AC converter topology is the direct matrix converter, the AC-link frequency is selected around 1 kHz and the power per module is in the range of 2.5 to 4 MW. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2013 The Authors.},

The resulting noise power spectral density (PSD) is thus characterized by spurious spikes. The presence of these singularities is for the first time justified from an analytical standpoint and their effects are shown by simulating some oscillators, employed as benchmarks. Furthermore, the presented approach justifies the 1/(fs-f)2 shape of the PSD of noise at the output when the fs frequency approaches the f fundamental of a stable oscillator and the 1/|fs-f|3 shape when the effects of flicker noise are manifest.

First, the switching network (SN) of a basic series-parallel topology is presented. The analysis reveals the assembly and growth rules for expanding the topology to any number of capacitors. Subsequently, the SN for the more versatile and complex general transposed series-parallel (GTSP) topology is presented. The topology is expanded by defining a basic cell comprising a capacitor and five peripheral switches. The expansion of this converter improves its performance by ameliorating accuracy and regulation in the dc/dc voltage ratio. The control schemes of these converters are also presented with emphasis on the GTSP topology, whose switches are not assigned in advance. The control scheme for achieving the desired voltage ratio is described. A five-capacitor converter with its control is built to illustrate the theory in open-loop mode, which provides experimental results that are in full agreement with the analytical predictions. {\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Modular dc-dc converters are popular in dc-power systems due to their advantageous characteristics such as fault tolerance, ease of thermal management, reducing voltage/current stress of the components, and modularity. In this paper, the concept of cooperative control in multiagent systems is introduced for modular dc-dc converters. Each constituent converter is represented by a node in a directed communication graph that models the information flow among converters. The proposed cooperative control scheme enjoys structural modularity, plug-and-play capability, fault tolerance against random failures in the converters and/or communication links, and satisfactory dynamic performance. This paper provides a general analytical framework to study modular dc-dc converters with an arbitrary communication graph. Hence, the designer has the freedom to choose among the various types of graphs based on the available communication resources and the desired level of reliability and fault tolerance. The dynamic model of the cooperative multiconverter system is developed and analyzed. Hardware measurements are presented to verify the plug-and-play capability, fault tolerance in both cyber and physical domains, and dynamic performance of the proposed cooperative control scheme.},

abstract = {This paper consists of the presentation of a regulation strategy capable of controlling the energy stored in the modular multilevel converter (MMC) in an HVDC configuration. This is achieved by regulating the positive, negative, and zero sequences in dqo coordinates of the differential current using two rotating reference frames: at once and at twice the fundamental grid frequency value. The active and reactive negative sequence components of the differential current at twice the fundamental frequency are used to eliminate the oscillations of the three-phased leg energy, reducing significantly the capacitor voltage oscillations, while the zero-sequence component is used to regulate the total energy stored at a given reference. Meanwhile, active and reactive positive sequence components of the circulating current are used for eliminating the average energy difference between the upper and lower arms in a three-phase MMC. In order to decouple efficiently the differential current components, the decoupled-double-synchronous-reference-frame current control strategy is used. Finally, simulation results validate the performance of the MMC in an HVDC configuration with the proposed control. Control equations are demonstrated, and cross-coupled leg-energy terms are introduced.},

abstract = {This paper presents a generalized and versatile control approach using Lagrange multipliers in the ABC frame for a modular multilevel converter-based HVDC system. The methodology is capable of analytically obtaining desired operative conditions by calculating the differential current references previously established by the constraints in the optimization formulation, while obtaining the result with minimum: 1) differential current oscillations ({\$}\Delta{\$}idiffk) or 2) capacitive phase-energy oscillations ({\$}\Delta{\$}{\$}\omega{\$}{\$}\Sigma{\$}k). Furthermore, the energy distribution inside the MMC (i.e., the capacitive phase average energy sum ({\$}\omega{\$}̅{\$}\Sigma{\$}k) and difference ({\$}\omega{\$}̅{\$}\Delta{\$}k)) is being regulated by means of the constraint definitions. The optimization yields a differential current reference in “abc” coordinates with a similar structure to instantaneous power theories: as the addition of the product between varying conductances and the MMC internal dynamics input voltages (i.e., the dc bus voltage (vdc) and the MMC load electromotice force (emf) (evk) on the one hand; and a contribution proportional to the ac load power (evkivk) on the other. Both the objective function minimization and the energy constraints are achieved with one single current reference resulting from the optimization process, without the application of linear superposition techniques.},

abstract = {The demand for decreasing costs and volume leads to a constantly increasing power density of industrial converter systems. In order to improve the power density further different aspects, like thermal management and electromagnetic effects must be considered in conjunction with the electrical design. Therefore, a comprehensive optimization procedure based on analytical models for minimizing volume of DC-DC converter systems has been developed at the Power Electronic Systems Laboratory of the ETH Zurich. Based on this procedure three converter topologies - a phase shift converter with current doubler and with capacitive output filter and a series-parallel resonant converter - are optimized with respect to power density for a telecom supply (400V/48V). There, the characteristic of the power density, the efficiency and the volume distribution between the components as function of frequency is discussed. For the operating points with maximal power density also the loss distribution is presented. Further more, the sensitivity of the optimum with respect to junction temperature, cooling and core material is investigated. The highest power density is achieved by the series-parallel resonant converter. For a 5 kW supply a density of approximately 12 kW/ltr. and a switching frequency of ca. 130 kHz results.},

The structure is based on three AC-DC converters each one connected to a different grid, (representing the main grid and/or various distributed generation systems) on the AC side, and linked together at DC side by suitable DC isolation modules. Each port of the UNIFLEX-PM system employs a conversion structure based on a three-phase 7-level AC-DC cascaded converter. Effective and accurate power flow control is demonstrated through simulation in Matlab and Simulink environment on a simplified model based on a two-port structure and using a stationery reference frame based control solution. Control of different power flow profiles has been successfully tested in numerous network conditions such as voltage unbalance, frequency excursions and harmonic distortion.},

Moreover, modern technologies provide various types of distributed energy resources (DER), constituted by small size generators and storage systems, that generate in direct current, such as photovoltaic arrays, fuel cells, storage, or that need DC section before the interfacing with the AC network (microturbines, variable speed wind generators, flywheels). It can be thought to integrate the various generators, storage systems and DC loads in a local DC distribution network, that is interfaced with public grid by means of one or more inverters. This solution makes easy the islanding operation of the generators. The aim of this work is to analyze a local DC distribution system both with diode and IGBT bridge interface converter in the presence of small scale generation and storage systems. After suitable modeling of the entire system, some simulation results are given.},

abstract = {Magnetic-less multilevel dc-dc converters attract much attention in automotive industry due to their small size, high efficiency, and high temperature operation features. A multilevel-modular capacitor-clamped dc-dc converter (MMCCC) is one of the most promising topologies among them with simple control and reduced switch current stress. This paper presents the optimal design considerations for an MMCCC to achieve the highest efficiency and the smallest size. In order to design the converter with the highest efficiency, the analytical power loss equation of an MMCCC should be derived. By considering the stray inductance in the circuit, the optimal design approach should be divided into two cases, overdamped case and underdamped case. The converter can be designed to achieve high efficiency in both cases by varying circuit parameters. If the circuit is designed in overdamped case, huge electrolytic capacitor bank has to be used to achieve high efficiency, which will increase the total converter size. If the circuit is designed in underdamped case, small-size multilayer ceramic capacitor can be utilized due to the low capacitance requirement. Although relatively high switching frequency is required in underdamped case due to practical considerations, zero-current switching (ZCS) can be achieved for all the switching devices which minimize the converter switching loss. Therefore, the optimal design point of an MMCCC with the smallest size and the highest efficiency should be selected at the underdamped case with ZCS for all the switches. Simulation results are provided to validate the design. A prototype of an MMCCC by using the proposed optimal design procedure is built. Experimental results of this optimal designed MMCCC prototype are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.},

abstract = {This paper presents a quasi-resonant technique for multilevel modular switched-capacitor dc-dc converter (MMSCC) to achieve zero-current switching (ZCS) without increasing cost and sacrificing reliability. This ZCS-MMSCC employs stray inductance distributed in the circuit as the resonant inductor to resonate with the capacitor and provide low {\{}{\textless}{\}}i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}dv{\{}{\textless}{\}}/i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} /{\{}{\textless}{\}}i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}dt{\{}{\textless}{\}}/i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} and {\{}{\textless}{\}}i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}di{\{}{\textless}{\}}/i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} /{\{}{\textless}{\}}i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}dt{\{}{\textless}{\}}/i{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} switching transition for the device. The ZCS-MMSCC does not utilize any additional components to achieve ZCS and meanwhile solves the current and voltage spike problem during the switching transition, thus leading to reliable and high-efficiency advantages over traditional MMSCC. Furthermore, the ZCS-MMSCC reduces the capacitance needed in the circuit to attain high efficiency. In this case, the bulky capacitor bank with high capacitance in a traditional MMSCC to reduce voltage difference and achieve high efficiency is no longer necessary. A 150-W four-level ZCS-MMSCC prototype has been built. Simulation and experimental results are given to demonstrate the validity and features of the proposed soft-switching switched-capacitor circuit.},

Immense growth has happened in the field of renewable energy and the energy harvesting methods in the past decade. It is estimated that there is still a huge potential of growth remaining in the field of renewable energy resources in the coming years. Generation of renewable energy at the source end to the transmission of the energy to the utility end is done at various interstates coupled with power electronic equipments and systems. Applications of power electronics are expanding at a high pace in industrial power generation, utility, grid integration, and transmission environments due to the advancements in technology and reduction in cost and size of the components and systems. There are numerous multistage converters and inverters topologies being developed for processing and delivering the gigawatt level of renewable power being produced. This paper highlights the growth of power electronics starting from semiconductor type switching devices to various multistage topologies which will extensively contribute to the development and growth of renewable energy resources around the globe. It is a fact that power electronics is an integral part of renewable energy generation and utilization and its optimization of size, cost, and performance is necessary for the most efficient harvesting. Latest advancements in the various ratings of switching devices and components are discussed in the paper.

abstract = {Due to increased attention towards clean and sustainable energy, distributed energy (DE) systems are gaining popularity all over the world. Power electronics are an integral part of these energy systems being able to convert generated electricity into consumer usable and utility compatible forms. But the addition of power electronics adds costs to the DE capital investments along with some reliability issues. Therefore, widespread use of distributed energy requires power electronics topologies that are less expensive and more dependable. Use of modular power electronics is a way to address these issues. Adoption of functional building blocks that can be used for multiple applications results in high volume production and reduced engineering effort, design testing, onsite installation and maintenance work for specific customer applications. In this paper, different power electronics topologies are reviewed that are typically used with distributed energy systems. The integrated power electronics module (IPEM) based back-to-back converter topologies are found to be most suitable interface that can operate with different DE systems with small or no modifications. Also the requirements for a hierarchical control structure with standardized power and communication interfaces are addressed in the paper along with some discussion on future design possibilities for the IPEM-based power electronics topologies. It is expected that modular and flexible power electronics and standardized controls and interfaces, will provide commonality in hardware and software for the power electronics interfaces, thus will enable their volume production and decrease their cost share in distributed energy applications. ?? 2009.},

Stability analysis of fundamental frequency phasor-based AVMs of MMCs can be conducted in a traditional linear time-invariant framework through eigenvalue computation. This class of models does not consider circulating current control loop and hence fails to capture system instability that occurs in a certain range of gains of the circulating current controller. We propose stability analysis in a linear time-periodic (LTP) framework to solve this issue. To that end, a nonlinear AVM is presented that considers the submodule capacitor insertion dynamics and takes into account the output and the circulating current control schemes in the vector control approach. Upon linearization, an LTP model is derived from this averaged model. It is shown that the Poincare multipliers are indicative of system instability corresponding to a certain range of gains of the circulating current controller.},

A continuous equivalent model of the MMC containing two ideal transformer models is presented. Using this model, the impact of a harmonic voltage upon the dc side is analyzed and the production mechanism of circulating harmonic currents is elucidated. At the same time, the impact of dead time and insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) voltage drop (DTVD) is studied, which indicates that capacitor voltages, output harmonics, and circulating harmonic currents are influenced. Based on this analysis, an open-loop control strategy to suppressing circulating harmonic currents caused by the output current and DTVD is presented. Finally, all these conclusions are verified using a simulation platform with 14 modules per arm fed by a 14-kV dc voltage source and a downscaled experimental platform with four modules per arm fed by a 560-V dc voltage source.},

abstract = {This study presents a control scheme that separates control of the fundamental current associated with AC power control from the DC and harmonic components in the arms of the H-bridge modular multi-level converter (MMC). In addition, this control scheme fully exploits the subtractive and additive switch states of the H-bridge MMC to maintain capacitor voltage balance when the converter DC-link voltage collapses during DC faults. The significance of this control scheme is that it permits the H-bridge MMC to ride through DC faults without the need for converter blocking, as is presented in the literature. This study provides comprehensive discussion of MMC fundamental theory, including a logical mathematical derivation of the relationships that governed its operation and modulation. The validity of the presented control scheme is confirmed using simulations and experimentations. Besides DC fault survival, this study presents operating the H-bridge-MMC from bi-polar DC-link voltages; thus, creating the possibility of complex hybrid DC grids with reversible DC-link voltage where the conventional line commutated current-source converters can operate alongside voltage-source converters. Operation of the H-bridge-MMC with reversible DC-link voltage is validated using simulation.},

Based on the coupled-resonator topology, the circuit area of the proposed power divider can be reduced as the size of the assembled resonators shrinks. Therefore, in order to effectively reduce the circuit area and improve the stopband performance, the net-type resonator is selected to design the filtering power dividers. For demonstration, power dividers with Chebyshev-and quasi-elliptic bandpass responses have been designed and fabricated with microstrip in printed circuit boards. The highly symmetric structure of each power divider provides a low in-band magnitude and phase imbalances. Consequently, the proposed filtering power dividers have advantages of small size, sharp skirt selectivity, high isolation, and superior out-of-band performance. All measured results are in good agreement with the full-wave simulation results.},

It is composed of three converter modules: buck converter, boost converter, and a dual active bridge converter that operates as a dc transformer (DCX). Eachmodule processes partial power, with reduced voltage rating.With the same semiconductor area and same magnetics volume, substantial efficiency improvements and reductions in capacitor size are achieved relative to a conventional boost architecture. It is possible to design each module to optimize efficiency over a wide operating range, including pass-through modes that exhibit very low loss. A 10-kW boost composite converter is experimentally demonstrated having 98.7{\%} efficiency at a critical partial power point, with similar very high efficiencies achieved over a wide operating range.},

abstract = {In this paper, we first discuss the definition of modularity ({\{}{\$}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}mbi{\{}{\{}{\}}Q{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} ) used as a metric for community quality and then we review the modularity maximization approaches which were used for community detection in the last decade. Then, we discuss two opposite yet coexisting problems of modularity optimization; in some cases, it tends to favor small communities over large ones while in others, large communities over small ones (so-called the resolution limit problem). Next, we overview several community quality metrics proposed to solve the resolution limit problem and discuss Modularity Density ({\{}{\$}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}mbi{\{}{\{}{\}}Q{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\_}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}bf ds{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} ), which simultaneously avoids the two problems of modularity. Finally, we introduce two novel fine-tuned community detection algorithms that iteratively attempt to improve the community quality measurements by splitting and merging the given network community structure. The first one, referred to as Fine-tuned {\{}{\$}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}mbi{\{}{\{}{\}}Q{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} , is based on modularity ({\{}{\$}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}mbi{\{}{\{}{\}}Q{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} ), while the second is based on Modularity Density ({\{}{\$}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}mbi{\{}{\{}{\}}Q{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\_}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}bf ds{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} ) and denoted as Fine-tuned {\{}{\$}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}mbi{\{}{\{}{\}}Q{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\_}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}bf ds{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} . Then, we compare the greedy algorithm of modularity maximization (denoted as Greedy {\{}{\$}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}mbi{\{}{\{}{\}}Q{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} ), Fine-tuned {\{}{\$}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}mbi{\{}{\{}{\}}Q{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} , and Fine-tuned {\{}{\$}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}mbi{\{}{\{}{\}}Q{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\_}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}bf ds{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\$}{\}} on four real networks, and also on the classical clique network and the LFR benchmark networks, each of which is i- stantiated by a wide range of parameters.

abstract = {Planar magnetic components using printed circuit board (pcb) windings are attractive due to their high repeatability, good thermal performance, and usefulness for realizing intricate winding patterns. To enable higher system integration at high switching frequency, more sophisticated methods that can rapidly and accurately model planar magnetics are needed. This paper develops a systematic approach to modeling impedances and current distribution in planar magnetics based on a lumped circuit model named as the modular layer model (MLM). Stacked pcb layers are modeled as repeating modular impedance networks, with additional modular impedances representing the magnetic core, air gaps, and vias. The model captures skin and proximity effects, and enables accurate predictions of impedances, losses, stored reactive energy, and current sharing among windings. The MLM can be used to simulate circuits incorporating planar magnetics, to visualize the electromagnetic fields, and to extract parameters for magnetic models by simulations, among many other applications. The modeling results are checked with results of previous theories and finite-element-modeling approaches, with good matching presented. A group of planar magnetic devices, including transformers and inductors with various winding patterns, are prototyped, and measured to validate the proposed approach and clarify the boundaries of its applicability.},

The input-series connection allows the use of low voltage MOSFET's optimized for very low R{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DS,ON{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} resulting in lower conduction losses. The common-duty-ratio scheme does not require a dedicated control loop for input voltage or output current sharing. The fault tolerant protection and control scheme accommodates failure of one or more modules, and ensures input voltage and load current sharing among the remaining healthy modules. The design of a new sensing scheme for detection of fault is presented. The analysis of the topology and the underlying principles are presented. The dependence of peak current from the source and in the protection switch in case of failure of a single converter has been analyzed and the various design tradeoff issues are discussed. The theoretical predictions are validated with simulation and experimental results. The proposed method is simple and gives good dynamic response to changes in input, load, and during fault. This topology is especially suited for space applications where a high level of fault tolerance can be achieved through designed redundancy.},

abstract = {A bidirectional zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) and zero-current-switching (ZCS) full-bridge dc-dc converter is proposed in this paper. The proposed full-bridge converter topology with low ripple input current, which converts the energy from battery to DC bus (or load) and vice versa. In order to improve the overall efficiency, the proposed bidirectional converter uses the leakage inductance of the transformer and a capacitor to achieve circuit resonance. The resonant frequency is operated in about double frequencies of the primary switch. In this paper, the main switches and output synchronous rectifiers are operated in ZVS and ZCS when being switched on and switched off. Converter description and operating principles of the proposed converter are discussed in this paper. Finally, a laboratory prototype with output power 250 W in both buck/charge operation mode and boost/discharge operation mode is implemented to validate the theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {Abstract The smart grid (SG) as a research area is advancing dealing with a wider range of topics such as power systems, energy generation and telecommunication. The conventional utility grid is used to operate in a passive mode absorbing energy from the substations and delivering it to the customers. This approach is well developed but the needs of the state-of-the-art technology require a bidirectional flow of power and data. Nevertheless, smart grid systems provide more flexible, reliable, sustainable, secure and two-way communication service. Especially, integration of renewable energy sources, electrical vehicles and distributed generations (DG) into network can be achieved in an efficient way in smart grid systems. Moreover, control and monitoring capabilities, automatic configuration of the grid, and active involvement of consumers in energy production extend the importance of smart grids. All these positive aspects of smart grids have been attained by integration of power electronics and telecommunication technologies with the grid. This study deals with contributions of power electronics to SG in the context of generation, conversion, distribution, and control of power. The recent power electronic devices and systems adapted to SG are also introduced in detail with several power control methods. Moreover, the renewable energy sources (RESs), which are an extensively studied topic of power engineering and their integration to smart grid, are also surveyed in terms of DG units, control and management features. Thus, a particular section is dedicated to RES utilization in SG covering almost all aspects of a monotype and hybrid energy plants. Finally, the survey is carried on by reviewing the most recent and comprehensive articles to highlight the importance of power electronics in a logical way in the smart grids for readers.},

abstract = {The attention of the end users to the electric power quality problem, the widespread use of the electronic power converters and the need to integrate the new distributed generation and storage systems have increased the interest in considering a public distribution system in direct current. The main idea is to extend the DC section, nowadays present in many electric devices, distributed generation systems and uninterruptible power supplies, at the level of LV public distribution. In this way it would be possible to create an high quality electric island that achieves also the advantages of the number and the complexity reduction of the power converters connected to the distribution network and a greater energy transport capacity with the same conductors [1]. In the present paper some possible circuital configurations are analyzed both from the technical and the economical points of view. Moreover, some remarks related to electrical safety have been presented. Finally, some simulation results are given. This paper was developed within the activity "Ricerca di Sistema" (DM 28/02/2003).},

abstract = {The common, and with some exceptions, the only method to interconnect high power renewable energy sources and energy storage systems to the power system has been using power electronics converters that operate as current sources to the grid, for the purpose of achieving maximum primary-source power tracking. When grid is not available, such sources are not allowed to continue operating and are shut-down after anti-islanded algorithms recognize the loss of the grid. Although existing standards and requirements still limit grid-interface converters to regulate voltage in the grid, this functionality will most probably be the dominant mode of their operation in the future grid; hence the growing trend in industry and academia to concentrate research towards control of the grid-interface converters that resemble behavior of the classic synchronous generators. This paper addresses modeling of the virtual synchronous machine-based grid-interface converters for renewable energy systems integration. Being completely equivalent to the synchronous generator model, an average model of the grid-interface converter features an inherent frequency-locked loop, in which the virtual rotor angle is obtained by integrating dc-link voltage.},

abstract = {Product modularity is often considered a crucial driver for the improvement of new product development (NPD) performance, in terms of NPD time and product performance, especially in those contexts characterized by a high product variety and constantly changing demand. However, quantitative studies demonstrating these links are scant and an increasing amount of anecdotal evidence suggests that there is a need to develop a more complete theory on the effects of product modularity on NPD time and product performance by examining the potential mediating effect of supplier involvement in NPD. To meet this need, we analyzed the impact of product modularity on NPD time and product performance, and whether supplier involvement in NPD can mediate “modularity-NPD time” and “modularity-product performance” relationships. Data from a sample of 201 manufacturing plants demonstrate that product modularity significantly affects NPD time and product performance. In addition, the impact of modularity was partially mediated by the involvement of suppliers in NPD. A better understanding of this effect can contribute to clarifying the mechanisms by which product modularity affects NPD time and product performance and thus could give guidance to managers on how to lever product modularity in order to improve the NPD process.},

The proposed algorithm features a relatively simple implementation without any conditional execution requirements and is easily expandable regardless of the number of submodules (SMs). Two modulation techniques are evaluated, namely the staircase modulation and the phase-disposition pulse width modulation (PD-PWM) under the conventional and the proposed algorithm. Using a circulating current controller in an MMC with 12 SMs per arm, PD-PWM yields better results compared to the staircase modulation technique. The test condition for this comparison is such that the power devices operate at a similar switching frequency and produce similar amplitudes to the capacitor voltage ripples in both modulation techniques. The results are verified through extensive simulations and experiments on a low power phase-leg MMC laboratory prototype.},

abstract = {Based on a course by the author at the University of Cambridge, this comprehensive text on turbulence and fluid dynamics is aimed at year 4 undergraduates and graduates in applied mathematics, physics and engineering and provides an ideal reference for industry professionals and researchers. It bridges the gap between elementary accounts of turbulence found in undergraduate texts and more rigorous accounts given in monographs on the subject. Containing exercises and many examples, the author combines the maximum of physical insight with the minimum of mathematical detail where possible. The text is highly illustrated throughout, and includes color plates; all required mathematical techniques are covered in extensive appendices. The text is divided into three parts: Part I consists of a traditional introduction to the classical aspects of turbulence, the nature of turbulence, and the equations of fluid mechanics. Mathematics is kept to a minimum, presupposing only an elementary knowledge of fluid mechanics and statistics. Part II tackles the problem of homogeneous turbulence with a focus on numerical methods. Part III covers certain special topics rarely discussed in introductory texts. Many geophysical and astrophysical flows are dominated by the effects of body forces, such as buoyancy, Coriolis and Lorentz forces. Moreover, certain large-scale flows are approximately two-dimensional and this has led to a concerted investigation of two-dimensional turbulence over the last few years.

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is increasingly becoming popular for multi-MW drive systems. One of the main technical challenges associated with the operation of MMC for adjustable-speed drives is the large magnitude of submodule (SM) capacitor voltage ripple under constant-torque low-speed operation. This paper proposes two new control strategies to reduce the magnitude of the SM capacitor voltage ripple in the MMC-based adjustable-speed drive systems under constanttorque low-speed operation. The proposed control strategies are based on injecting a square-wave common-mode voltage at the acside and a circulating current within the phase-legs to attenuate the low-frequency components of the SM capacitor voltages. The frequency spectrum of the injected circulating current consists of components in the vicinity of either the common-mode frequency or the common-mode frequency and third harmonic of the common-mode frequency. This paper also provides (i) a theoretical comparison of the proposed control strategies with the existing ones, (ii) a controller design methodology to systematically determine the controller gains of the proposed control strategies, and (iii) a theoretical proof of stability of the proposed control strategies and their design methodology based on Lyapunov analysis of singularly perturbed non-linear nonautonomous systems. A set of experimental results for various case studies on a laboratory-scale prototype are provided to support the theoretical proof of stability of the proposed control strategies and their design methodology, and to show the superior performance of the proposed strategies over the existing strategy.},

abstract = {The trend towards multimegawatt (multi-MW) wind turbines and the increasing interest in direct-drive variable-speed wind energy systems have made multilevel converters a promising candidate for large wind energy conversion systems. This paper presents a new hybrid modular multilevel converter for interfacing a full-scale, permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based direct-drive variable-speed wind energy conversion system (WECS). The proposed hybrid converter, which is used on the grid side of the system, consists of a three-level modular multilevel converter (MMC) in series connection with three H-bridge modules. The generator-side converter is based on a conventional three-level neutral-point-clamped converter. The proposed hybrid converter, as opposed to the existing full-scale multilevel converter-based wind energy systems, provides structural modularity and a higher dc-bus voltage utilization. This paper formulates and analyzes the internal dynamics of the proposed hybrid converter including the circulating currents and the capacitor voltage ripples. The ac components of the circulating currents, if not properly reduced, increase the amplitude of the capacitor voltage ripples, rating values of the converter components, and losses. Based on the analysis, closed-loop circulating current and capacitor voltage ripple reduction techniques are developed. The reduction of capacitor voltage ripples help reduce the capacitor value. A mathematical model is also developed for the overall WECS. Performance of the overall WECS, under the proposed multilevel converter-based topology and controls, is evaluated based on time domain simulations in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment.},

This paper proposed an effective fault detection and localization method for MMCs. An MMC fault can be detected by comparing the measured state variables and the estimated state variables with a Kalman filter. The fault localization is based on the failure characteristics of the SM in the MMC. The proposed method can be implemented with less computational intensity and complexity, even in case that multiple SM faults occur in a short time interval. The proposed method is not only implemented in simulations with professional tool PSCAD/EMTDC, but also verified with a down-scale MMC prototype controlled by a real-time digital signal controller in the laboratory.

The scalability of the DC CFC is easily achievable due to the identical bridge converter topology; the cost of this DC CFC is also relatively low due to its simple physical structure and low voltage ratings. The control performance of the DC CFC is tested on a meshed 3-terminal (3-T) HVDC grid, which is based on modular multilevel converters (MMC). The DC branch current control in the meshed MTDC grid is achieved using the proposed control strategy of the DC CFC, and is verified through case studies on the real-time digital simulator (RTDS).},

abstract = {This paper studies the inherent relationship between two widely used pulse width modulation (PWM) methods for multilevel converters, i.e., the space vector modulation (SVM) method, also called space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM), and the nearest-level modulation method. The nearest-level modulation method directly controls the voltage of each phase, while the SVM method simultaneously deals with all phases. It is demonstrated in this paper that the two modulation methods are functionally equivalent: with proper common-mode voltage injections, the nearest-level modulation method is equivalent to the SVM method; by selecting the appropriate redundant switching sequences and the corresponding duty cycles, the SVM method is equivalent to the nearest-level modulation method. Nevertheless, the SVM method can conveniently provide more flexibility of optimizing the switching patterns, without the need of designing sophisticated commonmode voltages. An efficient and flexible modulation method for any multiphase multilevel converter is therefore proposed, which combines the advantages of the nearest-level modulation and the SVM methods, i.e., both with less computational burden and high flexibility of optimizing the output waveforms. Simulation and experimental results validate the analysis.},

Future traction drives may operate directly from the mains without this transformer. A feasible concept for a transformerless drive system consists of series connected medium voltage converters applying modern high-voltage insulated gate bipolar transistors (HV-IGBTs). In a first design step, the switching characteristics and losses of 6.5-kV IGBTs are compared to 3.3-kV and 4.5-kV IGBTs which are already commercially used in traction applications. Based on the considered HV-IGBTs, the properties of multilevel converters are analyzed and their applicability to the transformerless system is evaluated. The paper focusses on a loss analysis of the converters. Reliability aspects and harmonic spectra are briefly discussed. Taking these design aspects into account, the three-level neutral point clamped converter turns out to be a reasonable solution to realize line and motor converter modules in a transformerless traction system.},

abstract = {DC microgrids (MGs) have been gaining a continually increasing interest over the past couple of years both in academia and industry. The advantages of DC distribution when compared to its AC counterpart are well known. The most important ones include higher reliability and efficiency, simpler control and natural interface with renewable energy sources (RESs), electronic loads and energy storage systems (ESSs). With rapid emergence of these components in modern power systems, the importance of DC in today's society is gradually being brought to a whole new level. A broad class of traditional DC distribution applications such as traction, telecom, vehicular and distributed power systems can be classified under DC MG framework and ongoing development and expansion of the field is largely influenced by concepts used over there. This paper aims firstly to shed light on the practical design aspects of DC MG technology concerning typical power hardware topologies and their suitability for different emerging smart grid applications. Then, an overview of the state of the art in DC MG protection and grounding is provided. Owing to the fact that there is no zero current crossing, an arc that appears upon breaking DC current cannot be extinguished naturally, making the protection of DC MGs a challenging problem. In relation with this, a comprehensive overview of protection schemes which discusses both design of practical protective devices and their integration into overall protection systems is provided. Closely coupled with protection, conflicting grounding objectives, e.g. minimization of stray current and common mode voltage are explained and several practical solutions are presented. Also, standardization efforts for DC systems are addressed. Finally, concluding remarks and important future research directions are pointed out.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of control strategies, stability analysis and stabilization techniques for DC microgrids (MGs). Overall control is systematically classified into local and coordinated control levels according to respective functionalities in each level. As opposed to local control which relies only on local measurements, some line of communication between units needs to be made available in order to achieve coordinated control. Depending on the communication method, three basic coordinated control strategies can be distinguished, i.e. decentralized, centralized and distributed control. Decentralized control can be regarded as an extension of local control since it is also based exclusively on local measurements. In contrast, centralized and distributed control strategies rely on digital communication technologies. A number of approaches to using these three coordinated control strategies to achieve various control objectives are reviewed in the paper. Moreover, properties of DC MG dynamics and stability are discussed. The paper illustrates that tightly regulated point-of-load (POL) converters tend to reduce the stability margins of the system since they introduce negative impedances, which can potentially oscillate with lightly damped power supply input filters. It is also demonstrated how the stability of the whole system is defined by the relationship of the source and load impedances, referred to as the minor loop gain. Several prominent specifications for the minor loop gain are reviewed. Finally, a number of active stabilization techniques are presented.},

abstract = {Current trends indicate that worldwide electricity distribution networks are experiencing a transformation toward direct current (dc) at both the generation and consumption level. This tendency is powered by the outburst of various electronic loads and, at the same time, the struggle to meet the lofty goals for the sharing of renewable energy sources (RESs) in satisfying total demand. RESs operate either natively at dc or have a dc link in the heart of their power electronic interface, whereas the end-point connection of electronic loads, batteries, and fuel cells is exclusively dc. Therefore, merging these devices into dedicated dc distribution architectures through corresponding dc?dc converters is an attractive option not only in terms of enhancing efficiency because of reduction of conversion steps but also for realizing power quality independence from the utility mains. These kinds of systems generally provide improved reliability in comparison to their alternating current (ac) counterparts since the number of active elements in dc?dc power electronic devices is smaller than in dc-ac converters. Control design in dc systems is also significantly simpler since there are no reactive and harmonic power flows or problems with synchronization.},

This control strategy enables the D-STATCOM system to compensate unbalanced nonlinear load even under asymmetrical grid fault conditions and it has no limitations on the cascaded number. Experimental results obtained from a 60-V 3-kVA downscaled prototype verify that this D-STATCOM system performs satisfactory, not only compensating for unbalanced nonlinear load but also keeping the capacitor voltages maintained at the given value even in unbalanced power systems.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel modulation and capacitor voltage control method for the modular multilevel converter (MMC) allowing the fixed switching frequency of 50 Hz. In the proposed modulation method, the switching angles are calculated through a new approach with reference to the nearest voltage level control. And then, every four pulse patterns are grouped together for averaging the dc and fundamental ac components in the output voltage of individual submodules. Accordingly, the absorbed power of each submodule could be self-balanced during few line periods simply by periodically swapping the pulse patterns. Moreover, the different power losses or different initial energy states of the submodules may also cause the dc capacitor voltage deviation although the absorbed power is equally distributed. Therefore, a closed-loop-based method of exchanging the leading or falling edges of pulse patterns is developed for dc capacitor voltage control. Simulation results show that the MMC circuit together with the proposed method functions very well in both rectifier and inverter modes. Experimental results on a single-phase MMC-based inverter with four submodules in one arm show the validity of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Large-scale grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion systems operate at low voltage and are interfaced to medium-voltage and high-voltage ac utility grids through one or two step-up voltage transformer stages. In addition, the power conversion is performed with either a single stage dc-ac converter (central inverter) or a two stage dc-dc/dc-ac (string or multi-string inverter). However, prime solar irradiation regions in the world are not always located close to available utility lines, and in some cases are far away from main consumption areas. Furthermore, long overhead transmissions lines ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}}400km) and underwater transmission lines above 70kM, HVDC has become the most cost-effective solution. Among HVDC technologies, voltage source converter based HVDC system, mainly based on the modular multilevel converter (MMC), have become popular due to smaller filters, multi-network connection and decoupling of active and reactive power. This paper explores a new large-scale PV plant configuration based on a dc-dc stage interfaced directly to an MMC based HVDC system. Since PV systems are dc by nature, the proposed solution has several advantages, particularly if combined directly with the HVDC power station. Some power circuit topologies are presented, including their corresponding control schemes. Simulation results are presented to provide a preliminary evaluation on the operation and performance of the proposed system.},

abstract = {The control methodology of the active power-line filter is the key element for its successful performance in mitigating the line current harmonics. The control system processes the distorted line current signal and forces the converter to inject the proper compensating current. At the same time, it regulates the dc term, i.e., the dc current in the current source converter topology and the dc voltage in the voltage source converter topology. In this paper, a new intelligent control scheme for a modular single-phase active power filter based on the current source converter (CSC) topology is proposed. The intelligent controller utilizes two adaptive linear neurons (ADALINEs) to process the signals obtained from the power-line. The first ADALINE (the Current ADALINE) extracts the harmonic components of the distorted line current signal and the second ADALINE (the Voltage ADALINE) estimates the fundamental component of the line voltage signal. The outputs of the two ADALINEs are used to construct the modulating signals of a number of CSC modules, each dedicated to eliminate a specific harmonic. The proposed controller is also responsible for activating selected CSC filter module(s) to the electric grid. The automated activation of the corresponding filter module(s) is based on the decision-making rules in accordance with the current total harmonic distortion (THDi) and the harmonic factor (HF) levels set by the IEEE 519-1992 standard. A special 3-level PWM switching strategy is proposed for the filter modules which results in a 50{\%} reduction in the overall switching losses compared with the 2-level method. The proposed controller adjusts the Idc in each CSC module based on the present magnitude of the corresponding harmonic current which results in optimum dc-side current value and minimal converter losses. The high speed, accuracy, efficiency and flexibility offered by the proposed controller, combined with the fast response and low dc energy storage requirement of CSC topology, are the main advantages of the proposed active filter system. The analytical expectations are verified by digital simulation using EMTDC simulation package.},

DC side fault blocking capability of the MMC has prompted significant research in recent years. In this paper, a new switched capacitor sub-module (SCSM) for MMCs is proposed which provides operation with DC fault blocking capability. Additionally, a successful voltage balancing is achieved with half the number of voltage sensors used with existing MMC cells. Generally, conventional sensor-based balancing techniques require a significant amount of measurements, 2m(N-1) voltage sensors and 2m current sensors, for an N-level m-phase MMC. The proposed cell will thus aid in reducing the complexity of the control system. Detailed illustration of the operational concept of the proposed architecture is presented in this work. A comparison between the proposed SCSM and other existing MMC cells has been included to highlight the benefits of the proposed SCSM. A simulation model for an MMC based HVDC system along with the proposed cell has been built to test its performance during normal as well as abnormal operating conditions. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.},

This development is driven by the growing share of electrical power generation by renewable energy sources that are located far from load centers and the increased use of distributed power generators in the distribution grid. Power converters that transfer the electric energy between voltage levels and control the power flow in dc grids will be key components in these systems. The recently presented modular multilevel dc converter (M2DC) and the three-phase dual-active bridge converter (DAB) are benchmarked for this task. Three scenarios are examined: a 15 MW converter for power conversion from an HVDC grid to an MVDC grid of a university campus, a gigawatt converter for feeding the energy from an MVDC collector grid of a wind farm into the HVDC grid, and a converter that acts as a power controller between two HVDC grids with the same nominal voltage level. The operation and degrees of freedom of the M2DC are investigated in detail aiming for an optimal design of this converter. The M2DC and the DAB converter are thoroughly compared for the given scenarios in terms of efficiency, amount of semiconductor devices, and expense on capacitive storage and magnetic components.},

abstract = {Demand for use of power electronics continues to increase, reaching many tens of MW and even greater than 100 MW. The size of power electronics is a real handicap for serving this demand. Power electronics building block (PEBB) is a generic strategic concept incorporating several technology aspects which have been foreseen as key to major reduction in cost, losses, size and weight of power electronics. The value of integration can be enhanced with standardization of interfaces of the building blocks and control/protections requirements. Therefore beyond the concept of physical building blocks, one must look to other aspects of integration, such as layout of building blocks, bus work connecting the blocks and standardization in order to derive the maximum benefits from the integration concepts. ONR has funded several manufacturers to develop PEBBs for a broad range of applications. Some of these designs are now commercially available, some are under development. This paper describes the latest PEBB based applications and introduces new concepts and technologies such as the hybrid-cascade concept for the high fidelity power drive which combines step-mode switching with pulse-width modulation to minimize both switching and conduction losses as well as current harmonic distortions},

A flexible and practical DC system at +350V, ±350V and ±700V is introduced and assessed in four case studies that compare AC to DC. It is concluded that: 1) DC grids outperform AC grids in large distribution systems, especially with increasing penetration of distributed generation. Results show energy savings up to 5{\%}; lower ecological damage; 65{\%} copper savings; and less capital investment due to removal of unnecessary equipment and reduced resistive losses. 2) Limitations exist in the lack of standards and regulations; and availability of suitable DC appliances and equipment.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design of new high-frequency transformer isolated bidirectional dc-dc converter modules connected in input-series-output-parallel (ISOP) for 20-kVA-solid-state transformer. The ISOP modular structure enables the use of low-voltage MOSFETs, featuring low on-state resistance and resulted conduction losses, to address medium-voltage input. A phase-shift dual-half-bridge (DHB) converter is employed to achieve high-frequency galvanic isolation, bidirectional power flow, and zero voltage switching (ZVS) of all switching devices, which leads to low switching losses even with high-frequency operation. Furthermore, an adaptive inductor is proposed as the main energy transfer element of a phase-shift DHB converter so that the circulating energy can be optimized to maintain ZVS at light load and minimize the conduction losses at heavy load as well. As a result, high efficiency over wide load range and high power density can be achieved. In addition, current stress of switching devices can be reduced. A planar transformer adopting printed-circuit-board windings arranged in an interleaved structure is designed to obtain low core and winding loss, solid isolation, and identical parameters in multiple modules. Moreover, the modular structure along with a distributed control provides plug-and-play capability and possible high-level fault tolerance. The experimental results on 1 kW DHB converter modules switching at 50 kHz are presented to validate the theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {Abstract—Modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become one of the most promising converter topologies for future high-power applications. A challenging issue of the MMC is the voltage balancing among arm capacitors. A good overall control system is also vital for the MMC, which should be based on sound mathematical model, readily adaptable for different applications, and capable of high performance. This paper presents a general control structure for MMC inverters, which is suitable for both voltage-based and energy-based control methods, and includes voltage balancing between the upper and lower arms. A new method for voltage balancing among arm capacitors, which is based on an improved pulse width modulation, is also presented. The proposed method avoids some major disadvantages found in present voltage balancing methods, such as voltage sorting algorithm, extra switching actions, interference with output voltage, etc. Furthermore, all switching actions are evenly distributed among power devices. The proposed control system as a whole can serve as a promising solution for practical applications, especially when the number of submodules (SMs) is high. Simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

In this study, a TO-247 packaged, 1.2KV, 15A SiC MOSFET manufactured by GE has been investigated. The static characteristics of the device have firstly been performed using an Agilent power curve tracer at room temperature to get basic device performance, including DC characteristics (current-voltage characteristics, I-V) and AC characteristics (capacitance-voltage characteristics C-V). The input, output, reverse transfer capacitance of SiC MOSFET (Ciss, Coss, Crss respectively) and package stray inductances are of vital importance to the SiC MOSFET as they determine the dynamic behavior of the device during switching transients. Based on the characterization results, two different modeling methods have been implemented for the SiC MOSFET. A double-pulse tester (DPT) was built to perform switching characteristics of SiC MOSFET at 100V drain bias, 10A load current level and the same DPT circuit has been implemented in Synopsys Saber to verify the device models previously built. By comparison of simulated static and dynamic characteristics to measurement data, both models we built have been verified. Good agreements were obtained between the device models and experimental results. Approaches to improve the models have been investigated and limitations of the model have been discussed.},

abstract = {This article presents three dynamic linear state space models of Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) which are suitable for small-signal dynamic studies and controller design. The three models differ by the number of states (two, six and ten) and therefore are suitable for different applications based on the required accuracy. The 2nd and 6th order models ignore dynamics of the second harmonics and circulating current suppression control (CCSC). The main challenges of dynamic analytical modelling of MMC are the non-linear multiplication terms in ABC frame equations for modulating oscillating signals. The multiplication non-linear terms are therefore considered directly in the rotating DQ frame. This requires simultaneous modeling in zero sequence, fundamental frequency DQ and double fundamental frequency DQ2 frames. The proposed linear analytical models are implemented in state-space in MATLAB. The validity and accuracy of the models are verified against detailed 401 level MMC model in PSCAD/EMTDC in both: time and frequency domains. The results show very good accuracy for the 10th order model and decreasing accuracy for the lower order models. The influence of PLL and CCSC gains on MMC dynamic is also studied using the proposed 10th model and the results verify the suitability of the model for this purpose.},

abstract = {Dc systems are gaining popularity because of its high efficiency, high reliability and easy interconnection of renewable sources as compared to ac systems. In standalone dc system, parallel dc-dc converters are used to interconnect storage element and loads. Use of master-slave controller for paralleling is limited because of its high cost, low reliability and complexity. Although conventional droop controllers overcome these limitations, they cannot simultaneously ensure equal current sharing (in per unit) and low-voltage regulation. This is due to the error in measurement of voltage feedback signal. To address this limitation, modified droop controller is proposed in this study. Circulating current between converters is used to modify nominal voltages such that error between them is reduced. This improves current sharing among converters. The advantage of the proposed method is that, equal current sharing is achieved along with low-voltage regulation. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through detailed simulation study. To confirm the viability of the scheme, experimental studies are carried out on a scaled-down laboratory prototype developed for the purpose and results are included in this study. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter (M2C) has become an increasingly important topology in medium- and high-voltage applications. A limitation is that it relies on positive and negative half-cycles of the ac output voltage waveform to achieve charge balance on the submodule capacitors. To overcome this constraint a secondary power loop is introduced that exchanges power with the primary power loops at the input and output. Power is exchanged between the primary and secondary loops by using the principle of orthogonality of power flow at different frequencies. Two modular multilevel topologies are proposed to step up or step down dc in medium- and high-voltage dc applications: the tuned filter modular multilevel dc converter and the push–pull modular multilevel dc converter. An analytical simulation of the latter converter is presented to explain the operation.},

abstract = {Historically, it came about that the analysis and design of the power electronic converter center around currents and voltages in the circuits. During the last decade, the electromagnetic character of power electronic converters became more important due to the noise that the switches generate, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards have been put in place to control the electromagnetic noise levels. In this contribution, it is argued that coming to grips with the electromagnetic operation of switch-mode power conversion presents a barrier of knowledge that will have to be crossed in order to achieve future meaningful innovation in switch-mode power conversion. Rigorous electromagnetic analysis using realistic parameters are used to indicate important issues relating fundamental limits and technological paths for future generations of power electronic converters. Electromagnetic integration in three dimensions creates new possibilities to increase power densities},

abstract = {Battery size of portable electronic devices is restricted by compact device form factors. To effectively utilize the relatively limited battery power, highly efficient DC-DC converters are employed. As portable devices remain in stand-by mode most of the time, improving light load efficiency is essential. In this paper, fast transient control method and linearly scaled gate-driving technique are used to improve the transient response and light-load efficiency of dc-dc converter. The transient response of dc-dc converter is closely related to the waiting time of the device to resume normal operation from standby. The fast transient control operates under a voltage controlled Pulse-Width Modulation mode during steady state and saturation mode during transient. Light load efficiency of DC-DC converter depends on frequency dependent losses and gate driving losses. The optimum gate driving voltage can be accurately modeled by a linear function of the load current to minimize frequency dependent loss. This is achieved by maintaining constant switching frequency and output ripple voltage. Simulation results show 5{\{}{\%}{\}} increase in light-load efficiency with an overall efficiency of 90{\{}{\%}{\}} and the transient recovery time of a 450 mA step load change to be less than 9�s.},

abstract = {Voltage balance issue of dc-link capacitors is very important for applications of a cascade multilevel converter or a modular multilevel converter. In this paper, a novel diode-clamped modular multilevel converter (DCM2C) topology is proposed and a power feedback control method is developed. With the developed control strategy, the proposed diode-clamped circuit becomes a controllable closed loop which enables the capacitor voltages to be clamped by low power rating clamping diodes. The proposed topology and control strategy has quicker response and requires much fewer voltage sensors than the normally used traditional method; therefore, the system performance improvement and cost reduction are expected. Based on the proposed DCM2C, a novel N +1-level cascade multilevel topology is proposed for a cascade active power filter (CS-APF). The simulation and experimental results from the CS-APF have demonstrated and verified the effectiveness of the proposed novel topology and control method.},

In order to enhance power handling capacity and power ratings, this paper proposes a novel parallel-connected modular multilevel converters topology, which assumes two modular multilevel converters directly connected at both AC and DC sides. However, two key problems should be solved in the parallel-connected MMCs: voltage balancing of all sub-modules and the circulating currents between two MMCs. Firstly, this paper focuses on circuit configurations and voltage-balancing control of parallel-connected modular multilevel converters (PMMCs), and the combination of average and individual voltage control methods enables the parallel-connected MMCs to achieve the voltage balancing of all sub-modules without using any external circuit. Next, a zero-sequence model is developed to predict the dynamics of the zero-sequence current, and then an effective zero-sequence current control loop is designed to attenuate the circulating current. Finally, Matlab simulations verified the performance of the proposed control strategy.},

abstract = {Shunt-interleaved electrical drive systems consisting of several parallel medium-voltage back-to-back converters enable power ratings of tens of MVA, low current distortions, and a very smooth air-gap torque. To meet stringent reliability and availability goals despite the large parts count, the modularity of the drive system needs to be exploited and a suitable fault-handling strategy that allows the exclusion and isolation of faulted threads is required. This avoids the shutdown of the complete system and enables the drive system to continue operation. If full power capability is also required in degraded mode operation, redundancy on a thread level needs to be added. Experimental results confirm that thread exclusion allows the isolation of the majority of faults without affecting the mechanical load. As the drive system continues to run, faulted threads can be repaired and then added on-the-fly to the running system by thread inclusion. As a result, the downtime of such a modular drive system is expected to not exceed a few hours per year.},

abstract = {This paper presents a resilient framework for faulttolerant operation in modular multilevel converters (MMCs) to facilitate normal operation under internal and external fault conditions. This framework is realized by designing and implementing a supervisory algorithm and a post-fault restoration scheme. The supervisory algorithm includes monitoring and decision-making units to detect and identify faults by analyzing the circulating current and submodule capacitor voltages in a very short time. The post-fault restoration scheme is proposed to immediately replace the faulty submodule with the redundant healthy one. The restoration is achieved by virtue of a multilevel modular capacitor-clamped dc/dc converter (MMCCC), which is redundantly aggregated to each arm of the MMC. This design effectively guarantees smooth mode transition and handles the failure of multiple submodules in a short time interval. In addition, a modified modulation scheme is presented to ensure submodule capacitor voltage balancing of the MMC without implementing any additional hardware. Fast fault identification, a fully modular structure, and robust post-fault restoration are the main features of the proposed framework. Digital time-domain simulation studies are conducted on a 21-level MMC to confirm the effectiveness and resilience of the proposed fault-tolerant framework during internal and external faults. Furthermore, the proposed framework is implemented in the FPGA-based RTLAB real-time simulator platform to validate its resilience in a hardware-in-the-loop setup.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a simple control method to achieve active sharing of input voltage and load current among modular converters that are connected in series at the input and in parallel at the output. The input-series connection enables a fully modular power-system architecture, where low voltage and low power modules can be connected in any combination at the input and/or at the output, to realize any given specifications. Further, the input-series connection enables the use of low-voltage MOSFETs that are optimized for very low R{\textless}sub{\textgreater}DSON {\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, thus, resulting in lower conduction losses. In the proposed scheme, the duty ratio to all the converter modules connected in input-series and output-parallel (ISOP) configuration is made common. This scheme does not require a dedicated input-voltage or load-current-share controller. It relies on the inherent self-correcting characteristic of the ISOP connection when the duty ratio of all the converters is the same. The proposed scheme is analyzed using the average model of a forward converter. The stability and performance of the scheme are verified through numerical simulation, both in frequency domain and in time domain. The proposed control method is also validated on an experimental prototype ISOP system comprising of two forward converters},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel modular multilevel series/parallel converter that allows switching modules dynamically not only in series, as in the traditional modular multilevel converter (M2C), but also in parallel. As in M2C, the semiconductor voltages do not exceed the module capacitor voltage for any module state. While the new topology is a generalization of M2C and could, therefore, be operated identically to it, the additional states provide degrees of freedom that the controller can dynamically employ to achieve several advantages. Whereas in M2C many modules are bypassed if the instantaneous converter voltage is lower than the system's peak voltage, the parallel connectivity enables these modules to contribute to the current load, thus reducing conduction losses. In addition, the parallel configuration of modules can be used for balancing the modules' state of charge (SOC). The parallelization losses are moderate or negligible, dependent on the switching rate. Since the parallel connection of capacitors can ensure balancing, it enables stable operation of a multilevel converter without the need for monitoring the module SOCs. While such economical control hardware may be appropriate for low-power systems, we also present more sophisticated control that uses the additional degrees of freedom to minimize losses. Finally, we point to further extensions of the circuit topology to multipole module connectivity that could enable additional functionality and applications.},

The conventional model predictive control (MPC) strategies for the MMC are not practical due to their substantial calculation requirements, especially under high number of voltage levels. To solve this problem, a fast MPC strategy combined with a submodule-voltage sorting balancing method is proposed based on the discrete mathematical model derived for the MMC in this paper. By optimizing the implementation of the control objectives and simplifying the rolling optimization, the proposed strategy is simpler to expand to a system with larger number of submodules, with the amount of calculation reduced and the advantages of the conventional MPC algorithm reserved. In addition, the proposed control can minimize the dv/dt of the output voltages. Both steady-state and transient performances are evaluated by a down-scaled three-phase MMC prototype under various experimental conditions, which validates the proposed fast MPC strategy.},

abstract = {DC fault protection is one challenge impeding the development of multiterminal dc grids. The absence of manufacturing and operational standards has led to many point-to-point HVDC links built at different voltage levels, which creates another challenge. Therefore, the issues of voltage matching and dc fault isolation are undergoing extensive research and are addressed in this paper. A quasi two-level operating mode of the modular multilevel converter is proposed, where the converter generates a square wave with controllable dv/dt by employing the cell voltages to create transient intermediate voltage levels. Cell capacitance requirements diminish and the footprint of the converter is reduced. The common-mode dc component in the arm currents is not present in the proposed operating mode. The converter is proposed as the core of a dc to dc transformer, where two converters operating in the proposed mode are coupled by an ac transformer for voltage matching and galvanic isolation. The proposed dc transformer is shown to be suitable for high-voltage high-power applications due to the low-switching frequency, high efficiency, modularity, and reliability. The dc transformer facilitates dc voltage regulation and near instant isolation of dc faults within its protection zone. Analysis and simulations confirm these capabilities in a system-oriented approach.},

However, scaling the two-level dual-active bridge to higher dc voltage levels is impeded by several challenges among which the high dv/dt stress on the coupling transformer insulation. Gating and thermal characteristics of series switch arrays add to the limitations. To avoid the use of standard bulky modular multilevel bridges, this paper analyzes an alternative modulation technique, where staircase approximated trapezoidal voltage waveforms are produced; thus, alleviating developed dv/dt stresses. Modular design is realized by the utilization of half-bridge chopper cells. This way the analyzed dc-dc transformer employs modular multilevel converters operated in a new mode with minimal common-mode arm currents, as well as reduced capacitor size, hence reduced cell footprint. Suitable switching patterns are developed and various design and operation aspects are studied. Soft-switching characteristics will be shown to be comparable to those of the two-level dual-active bridge. Experimental results from a scaled test rig validate the presented concept.},

abstract = {In this paper the authors first highlight an exist- ing over-voltage phenomenon that is inherent to the Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) topology. The latter occurs during the blocking sequences of semiconductor devices if the converter needs to be stopped due to circulating current, loss of control or unexpected faults. An analysis based on time domain expressions describing each operating sequence during normal and faulty blocking conditions is used to demonstrate the origin of this over- voltage. Thereafter, system behaviour is obtained when devices gating signals are withheld as well as the exact over-voltage cause. Real-time simulation, with sub-microsecond time-steps, and experimental results validate the over-voltage phenomena and the proposed remedial strategy to avoid uncontrolled faulty conditions.},

abstract = {—The voltage source converter (VSC) station is playing a more important role in modern power systems, but the dynamic behavior of the VSC station is quite different from that of the syn-chronous generator. This paper presents the synchronous gener-ator emulation control (SGEC) strategy for the VSC-HVDC sta-tion. The SGEC strategy is divided into the inner control loop and the outer control loop. The inner controller is developed for fast current and voltage regulations. An inertia element is introduced into the frequency-power droop to determine the command refer-ence of the frequency, and the inertia response and the primary frequency regulation are emulated. In addition, the secondary fre-quency regulation can be achieved by modulating the scheduled power in the SGEC strategy. The time-domain simulation results demonstrate the VSC station with the proposed control strategy can provide desired frequency support to a low-inertia grid. There-fore, the SGEC strategy provides a simple and practical solution for the VSC station to emulate the behavior of a synchronous gen-erator.

This paper presents a generalized mathematical model for MMC in HVDC applications under balanced and unbalanced grid conditions. The dynamics of the positive-, negative-, and zero-sequence components are derived from the model. Then, a dual current control scheme with positive- and negative-sequence current controllers is applied to MMC. The power controller to eliminate negative-sequence current components and the other one to eliminate double-line-frequency voltage ripple are compared. Moreover, a zero-sequence current controller is proposed in addition to the positive- and negative-sequence current controllers. Time-domain simulations on a 61-level MMC-HVDC test system are performed in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. The results demonstrate that the MMC-HVDC system with or without converter transformer is able to operate under unbalanced conditions by the use of the proposed control scheme.},

The system operation under normal and abnormal conditions was comprehensively investigated. Internal Model Control (IMC) technique was adopted for tuning the controllers. An elaborate switching modulation strategy was used to reduce the current ripple and inductor size, while maintaining high efficiency. Annotative, simple and robust remedial strategies were proposed to mitigate different anticipated faults. Comprehensive simulation results in Matlab environment were illustrated for corroborating the performance of the advised cascaded DC/DC system under normal/abnormal conditions. The proposed system enjoys the merits of independency, reduced volumetric dimensions and improved efficiency. Furthermore, the system is inherently fault-tolerant.},

abstract = {Modular multilevel converters (M2Cs) are increas- ingly used in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems. The efficiency of M2Cs is influenced by the modulation and cell se- lecting methods, which determines the switching frequency and capacitor voltage ripple in the converter station. A new approach to modulation of the M2C is presented in this paper. Tolerance band methods are employed to obtain the switching instants, and also cell selection. The proposed methods overcome the modula- tion problem for converters with few cells on one hand and also reduce the sorting efforts for cell balancing purposes ofmany cells converter on the other hand. Three different algorithms are also proposed to balance the cell capacitor voltages. The evaluation is done in time-domain simulation by which the performance of each method is studied in both the steady-state and transient cases. It is observed that using tolerance band methods not only reduces the switching frequency but also allows for handling severe fault cases in a grid-connected system. Eventually, the most promising tolerance band method has been implemented and verified in a real-time digital simulator, RTDSR ?. The average switching fre- quency of 70 Hz has been achieved for the system under study, while the capacitor voltage ripple is limited to 10{\{}{\%}{\}} of the nominal cell voltage.},

abstract = {Apparently, modular multilevel converter (MMC) has been extensively used in high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission links in recent years. The efficiency of MMC stations are highly related to the switching methods and semiconductor devices. So, various switching methods and semiconductor devices have been investigated and introduced in the field. This paper settles a benchmark for an HVDC link, based on a real project, and investigates the impact of six different switching methods on the converter loss, utilizing a commercial semiconductor device. The evaluation indicates that switching methods which consider the current level at switching instants are more efficient in comparison with the other methods which only consider the number of switching events. The result of this study is essential for more efficient converter stations.},

abstract = {In a modular multilevel converter (MMC), the interaction between switching actions and fluctuating capacitor voltages of the submodules results in second- and other even-order harmonics in the circulating currents. These harmonic currents will introduce extra power loss, increase current stress of power devices and even cause instability during transients. Traditional methods for circulating current harmonics suppression have problems such as limited harmonics rejection capability, limited application area, and complex implementation. This paper presents a plug-in repetitive control scheme to solve the problem. It combines the high dynamics of PI controller and good steady-state harmonics suppression of the repetitive controller, and minimizes the interference between the two controllers. It is suitable for multiple harmonics suppression, easy to implement and applicable for both single-phase and three-phase MMCs. Simulation and experimental results on a single-phase MMC inverter proved the validity of the proposed control method.},

abstract = {A novel quasi-resonant bridge modular switched- capacitor converter (BMSCC) is proposed in the paper. The main merit is that its resonant circuit has high stability and simplicity, resulting fromthe employment of the stray inductance distributed in the circuit as a collective resonant inductor. Accordingly, the current spike during switching operation is removed due to zero- current-switching (ZCS) realization. Another distinctmerit is that the proposed converter features symmetric construction.With this kind of construction, the voltage ripple of charge/pump capacitors can be cancelled out with each other and then output voltage rip- ple will be largely reduced. Thus, it is unnecessary to use a bulky capacitor to reduce output voltage ripple. Compared with conven- tional SCCs, at the same conversion ratio, the BMSCC with sym- metric construction requires fewer switches and capacitors with lower voltage stress, so as to cut the size and cost and promote the power destiny further. It is also noteworthy that the symmetric construction character assures that the two symmetric parts can work independently under a simplified control strategy. In addi- tion, the modular configuration contributes to convenient voltage extension conveniently. The simulation and experimental results of a 100Wprototype with a voltage conversion ratio of eight validate the principle and features of this topology.},

A micro-gird is an electrically isolated set of generators that supply all of the demand of a group of customers. Micro-grids are not burdened with the costs of the existing system (which can result in a cost savings) but they must reliably supply all of the demand without the benefits of a diverse set of loads and generation technologies (which can result in a cost increase).

To achieve the autonomous control of the microgrid, the plug and play(PnP) power electronics interface for DER is a good solution to support device self-identification and system resources assignment. In the paper, the hardware architecture is built by using integrated power electronics module and a novel hierarchical software architecture is proposed by standardizing interfaces between levels.

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is emerging to be a promising approach for medium- and high-voltage applications. This paper proposes a modified nearest level modulation (NLM) method for the MMC, with which the level number of ac output voltage increases to 2N+1 (where N is the sub-module numbers per arm) as great as that of the carrier-phase-shifted PWM (CPSPWM) and the improved sub-module unified PWM (SUPWM) methods. The level number is almost doubled and the height of the step in the step wave is halved. Therefore, the ac output voltage waveform quality using the proposed method is better than that using the conventional NLM method. Besides, the proposed method keeps the conventional NLM method's characteristics such as low switching frequency and simple implementation. The performance of the proposed method is verified by simulations and experiments using a laboratory-scale prototype.},

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a newly introduced switch-mode converter topology with the potential for high-voltage and high-power applications. This paper focuses on the design and control methods for fault-tolerant operation using redundant submodules (SMs), which is one of the most important features in the MMC topology. By comparing three design schemes of redundant SMs, the most economic and reliable scheme is identified. In addition, a mathematical model of the MMC with arms containing different numbers of SMs is developed. Based on the identified scheme and mathematical model, an energy-balancing control strategy is proposed to keep the MMC operating normally under SM fault conditions. Finally, time-domain simulations of a 61-level MMC system are performed, using the PSCAD/EMTDC software, while experiments are carried out on a 41-level MMC prototype. The simulation and experimental results validate the design scheme, mathematical model, and proposed energy-balancing control strategy.},

abstract = {This paper introduces techniques to reduce energy storage in off-line light-emitting diode (LED) drivers. Rather than targeting the ideals of unity input power factor (PF) and constant LED current, a topology is selected to minimize the required energy storage with the more practical targets of 0.9 PF and a selectable LED current ripple. The objectives are accomplished using a combination of the following: first, constant-input-current regulation, which results in 0.9 PF and 34{\&}{\#}x0025; less required energy storage than when using unity power factor, and is achieved with a simple reference signal that does not require input voltage sensing; second, a two-stage approach that isolates the LED from the capacitor to allow full use of the stored energy; third, a bidirectional second stage (LED string is between the two stages) that processes only the necessary energy storage; and fourth, a selectable regulation band on the LED current ripple to pass through the maximum allowed double-line-frequency ripple. The topology is applied to the series-input modular architecture to utilize low-voltage high-frequency circuits and low-profile components in off-line applications. Experimental results are presented for a series-input system with three modules each driving eight LEDs with 30{\&}{\#}x0025; double-line-frequency current ripple using small filter capacitors.},

abstract = {The modular development of a three-phase, single-stage AC-DC power converter based on single-phase AC-DC full-bridge converters is described. Three-wired and four-wired modular converter systems are examined and compared. The three-wired system is found to have inherent power factor correction and is better than the four-wired system in terms of harmonic content. The fluctuation of the converter neutral voltage in the three-wired system and the voltage stress on the power switches are analysed. A simulation based on a PSPICE model is included. The modular converter does not have a minimum component count when compared with non-modular converters. But the modular converter offers attractive features such as simple DC-DC switching control, electrically isolated output, inherent power factor correction and single-stage power conversion without using power devices with excessively high voltages and current ratings. It also has flexible power expandability and the potential to simplify the design and production of high-power AC-DC power converter products. The operation of the modular full-bridge converter has been confmed with a 1.5kW prototype. Both predictions and measurements show that the power quality of three-wired modular converter system is good and well above IEC-1000 standards.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new modulation method for the modular multilevel converter. The proposed method is based on a fixed pulse pattern where harmonic elimination methods can be applied. Modulation methods with harmonic elimination based on calculated pulse patterns have been presented for other multilevel topologies. However, similar modulation schemes have not yet been presented for the modular multilevel topology. In the proposed modulation method, the pulse pattern is chosen in such a way that the stored energy in each submodule remains stable. It is shown that this can be done at the fundamental switching frequency without measuring the capacitor voltages or using any other form of feedback control. Such a modulation scheme has not been presented before. The theoretical results are verified by both simulations and experimental results. The simulation results show successful operation at the fundamental switching frequency with a larger number of submodules. When a smaller number of submodules are used, harmonic elimination methods may be applied. This is verified experimentally on a converter with eight submodules per phase leg. The experimental results verify that stable operation can be maintained at the fundamental switching frequency while successfully eliminating the fifth harmonic in the ac-side voltage.},

Suitable switching frequencies are derived for which the arm and line quantities will be periodic with symmetric operating conditions in the upper and lower arms. Thus, the practical outcome of this paper is a detailed description of how the switching frequency should be chosen in order to achieve advantageous operating conditions.

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter is a promising topology for high-voltage and high-power applications. By using submodules equipped with dc-capacitors excellent output voltage waveforms can be obtained at low switching frequencies. The rated energy storage of the submodule capacitors is a driving factor of the size, cost, and weight of the submodules. Although the modular multilevel converter has been thoroughly investigated in the literature, a more detailed analysis of the energy-storage requirements will provide an important contribution for dimensioning and analysis of modular multilevel converters. Such an analysis is presented in this paper. The analysis relates the power transfer capability to the stored energy in the converter and the findings are validated by both simulations and experimental results. The required size of the submodule capacitors in a 4.5 MW grid-connected converter is first calculated and the calculated operating range is then compared with simulation results. The experimental results show that if the average capacitor voltage is allowed to increase 10{\{}{\%}{\}} above the nominal value an energy storage to power transfer ratio of 21 J/kW can be achieved. It is concluded that the presented theory can relate the power transfer capability to the energy storage in the converter and is thus a valuable tool in the design and analysis of modular multilevel converters.},

abstract = {Recent advances in solid-state semiconductors have led to the development of medium-voltage power converters (e.g., 6-36 kV) which could obviate the need for the step-up transformers of renewable power generation systems. The modular multilevel cascaded converters have been deemed as strong contenders for the development of medium-voltage converters, but the converters require multiple isolated and balanced dc supplies. In this paper, a high-frequency link multilevel cascaded medium-voltage converter is proposed. The common high-frequency link generates multiple isolated and balanced dc supplies for the converter, which inherently minimizes the voltage imbalance and common mode issues. An 11-kV system is designed and analyzed taking into account the specified system performance, control complexity, cost, and market availability of the power semiconductors. To verify the feasibility of the proposed system, a scaled down 1.73-kVA laboratory prototype test platform with a modular five-level cascaded converter is developed and explored in this paper, which converts a 210 V dc (rectified generator voltage) into three-phase 1 kV rms 50 Hz ac. The experimental results are analyzed and discussed. It is expected that the proposed new technology will have great potential for future renewable generation systems and smart grid applications.},

abstract = {A comparison has been made of the converter lifetime for a 3MW fully rated converter horizontal axis wind turbine located onshore and offshore. Simulated torque and speed of the turbine shaft were used to calculate voltage and current time series, that was used to calculate the junction temperatures of the diode and IGBT in the generator-side converter by a thermal-electrical model. A rainflow counting algorithm was applied to the junction temperature in combination with an empirical model of the lifetime estimation, to calculate the lifetime of the power electronic modules in the turbine. The number of parallel modules for each location to achieve 20 years life time has also been found. Simulations show the lifetime consumption rate of the diode and IGBT is decreased exponentially by increasing number of parallel modules, lowering the average temperature. The offshore wind turbine has a higher lifetime consumption rate, requiring a slightly higher converter rating to achieve a 20-year lifetime, but this difference is small, and both turbines will use the same number of modules.},

Theoretically, the energy balance in the cell capacitors is prone to be unstable at startup and low frequency operation. Therefore, the MMC topology essentially requires advanced strategies for energy balancing so as to suppress the voltage pulsation of each cell capacitor. The pulsation is getting larger as the output frequency of MMC is getting lower. This paper proposes a strategy for robust dynamic response even at zero output frequency of MMC employing leg offset voltage injection. With this proposed strategy, an AC machine has been driven from standstill to rated speed without excessive cell capacitor voltage ripples. The experimental results verify that stable operation is guaranteed for both a 15r/min operation with 40{\{}{\%}{\}} step load torque and the entire frequency operation with varying load torque.},

The European Union (EU) low voltage directive (LVD 72/23/EEC) [1] defines the boundaries for the low voltage (LV) levels used in public distribution systems. According to the directive any electrical equipment designed to be used with a voltage rating between 50-1000 V AC and between 75-1500 V DC is a low voltage instrument. The utilization of the 1 kV AC-distribution system takes full advantage of the LVD 73/23/EEC directive's AC-definition. However, the DC voltage rating is still unexploited in public distribution systems. As the weight of cost efficiency and reliability requirements of distribution networks are expected to increase in the future, with the utilization of distributed generation, there will be demand for novel distribution techniques. The utilisation of the LV-DC- distribution opens new possibilities for network development. In this paper, the basic concepts and the techno-economical potential of the LV-DC-systems are discussed. Also aspects of developing required power electronic equipment for LV-DC-systems are introduced.},

abstract = {Expectations both on electricity distribution techniques and the distribution business are growing. The EU low voltage directive (LVD 72/23/EEC) [1] enables the use of 1 kV low voltage level as a third distribution voltage level between the traditional 20 kV and the 0.4 kV networks. This has proved to be a cost-efficient solution to enhance the reliability of electricity distribution. Similarly with the AC low voltage systems, the EU low voltage directive defines the boundaries for voltages used in the DC low voltage systems. According to the directive, any electrical equipment designed for use with a DC voltage rating between 75 and 1500 V DC is a low voltage instrument [1]. This includes also the distribution systems. The DC-systems and power electronics are the emerging technologies in electricity distribution. The utilization of the DC low voltage distribution opens new possibilities for network development. For example, with the same voltage drop and the same 3{\{}{\~{}}{\}}cable 16 times more power can be transmitted with a 1.5 kV DC-system than with 0.4 kV AC system. In the proposed paper, the basic concepts and the techno-economical potential of the low voltage DC-systems are discussed. Also aspects of developing required power electronic equipment for low voltage DC systems are introduced.},

abstract = {Diverse and dynamic load and generation patterns are putting new demands on the operation of distribution networks. New network management approaches and innovative equipment are needed to handle highly volatile voltage profiles resulting from intermittent distributed generation. This paper investigates the use of an inline voltage regulator in a LV network. As simulations based on realistic feed-in scenarios show, it is an efficient tool for influencing a network's voltage profile. Since voltage regulation is not required permanently, such a flexible power electronic device can be further used to increase a power system's efficiency and reliability by implementing features such as reactive power compensation or mitigation of harmonics. Concerning this matter, an approach for an adaptive system management is discussed that allows the provision of additional functionality whenever the converter is not used to its full capacity for the voltage regulation task.},

abstract = {In this paper, the analysis and design of a modular three-phase AC-to-DC converter using single-phase isolated Cuk rectifier modules is discussed based on power balance control technique. This paper analyzes the operation of a modular converter as continuous-conduction-mode power factor correction (CCM-PFC). Design equations, as well as an average small-signal model of the proposed system to aid the control loop design are derived. It is used to obtain the inductor current compensator, thus the output impedance and audio susceptibility become zero, and therefore, the output voltage of the converter presented in this paper is independent of the variations of the dc load current and the utility voltage. The control strategy consists of a single output voltage loop and three-inductor current calculator. The main objective of the proposed system is to reduce the number of stages and improve dynamic response of DC bus voltage for distributed power system. The proposed scheme offers simple control strategy, flexibility in three-phase delta or star-connected, simpler design, fast transient response, good inductor current sharing, and power factor closed to unity. Both simulation and experimental results are presented. They are in agreement with the theoretical analysis and experimental work.},

abstract = {A standard exercise in elementary quantum mechanics is to describe the properties of an electron confined in a potential well. The solutions of Schrodinger's equation are electron standing waves-or 'quantum-well' states-characterized by the quantum number n, the number of half-wavelengths that span the well. Quantum-well states can be experimentally realized in a thin film, which confines the motion of the electrons in the direction normal to the film: for layered semiconductor quantum wells, the aforementioned quantization condition provides (with the inclusion of boundary phases) a good description of the quantum-well states. The presence of such states in layered metallic nanostructures is believed to underlie many intriguing phenomena, such as the oscillatory magnetic coupling of two ferromagnetic layers across a non-magnetic layer(1,2) and giant magnetoresistance(3). But our understanding of the properties of the quantum-well states in metallic structures is still limited. Here we report photoemission experiments that reveal the spatial variation of the quantum-well wavefunction within a thin copper film. Our results confirm an earlier proposal(4) that the amplitude of electron waves confined in a metallic thin film is modulated by an envelope function (of longer wavelength), which plays a key role in determining the energetics of the quantum-well states.},

abstract = {A multilevel modular capacitor-clamped DC-DC converter (MMCCC) will be presented in this paper with some of its advantageous features. By virtue of the modular nature of the converter, it is possible to integrate multiple loads and sources with the converter at the same time. The modular construction of the MMCCC topology provides autotransformer-like taps in the circuit, and depending on the conversion ratio of the converter, it becomes possible to connect several dc sources and loads at these taps. The modularity of the new converter is not limited to only this dc transformer (auto) like operation, but also provides redundancy and fault bypass capability in the circuit. Using the modularity feature, some redundant modules can be operated in bypass state, and during some faults, these redundant modules can be used to replace a faulty module to maintain an uninterrupted operation. Moreover, by obtaining a flexible conversion ratio, the MMCCC converter can transfer power in both directions. Thus, this MMCCC topology could be a solution to establish a power management system among multiple sources and loads having different operating voltages.},

abstract = {This paper presents the various configurations of a multilevel modular capacitor-clamped converter (MMCCC), and it reveals many useful and new formations of the original MMCCC for transferring power in either an isolated or nonisolated manner. The various features of the original MMCCC circuit are best suited for a multibus system in future plug-in hybrid or fuel-cell-powered vehicles' drive train. The original MMCCC is capable of bidirectional power transfer using multilevel modular structure with capacitor-clamped topology. It has a nonisolated structure, and it offers very high efficiency even at partial loads. This circuit was modified to integrate single or multiple high-frequency transformers by using the intermediate voltage nodes of the converter. On the other hand, a special formation of the MMCCC can exhibit dc outputs offering limited isolation without using any isolation transformer. This modified version can produce a high conversion ratio from a limited number of components and has several useful applications in providing power to multiple low-voltage loads in a hybrid or electric automobile. This paper will investigate the origin of generating ac outputs from the MMCCC and shows how the transformer-free version can be modified to create limited isolation from the circuit. In addition, this paper will compare various modified forms of the MMCCC topology with existing dc-dc converter circuits from compactness and component utilization perspectives.},

abstract = {DC-DC converter is one of the mostly used power electronic circuits, and it has applications in various areas ranging from portable devices to aircraft power system. Various topologies of dc-dc converters are suitable for different applications. In high power applications such as the bi-directional dc-dc converter for dual bus system in new generation automobiles, several topologies can be considered as a potential candidate. Regardless of the topology used for this application, the reliability of the converter can be greatly enhanced by introducing redundancy of some degree into the system. Using redundancy, uninterrupted operation of the circuit may be ensured when a fault has occurred. The redundancy feature can be obtained by paralleling multiple converters or using a single modular circuit that can achieve this attribute. Thus, a modular dc-dc converter with redundancy is expected to increase the reliability and reduce the system cost. Recently, the advancement in power electronics research has extended its applications in hybrid electric automobiles. Several key requirements of this application are reliable, robust, and high efficiency operation at low cost. In general, the efficiency and reliability of a power electronic circuit greatly depend on the kind of circuit topology used in any application. This is one of the biggest motivations for the researchers to invent new power electronic circuit topologies that will have significant impact in future automobile industry. This dissertation reviews existing modularity in power electronic circuits, and presents a new modular capacitor clamped dc-dc converter design that has many potential uses in future automotive power system. This converter has multilevel operation, and it is capable of handling bi-directional power. Moreover, the modular nature of the converter can achieve redundancy in the system, and thereby, the reliability can be enhanced to a great extent. The circuit has a high operating efficiency ({\{}{\textgreater}{\}}95{\{}{\%}{\}}), and it is possible to integrate multiple voltage sources and loads at the same time. Thus, the converter could be considered as a combination of a power electronic converter and a power management system. In addition to the new dc-dc converter topology, a new pair of modular blocks defined as switching cells is presented in this dissertation. This pair of switching cells can be used to analyze many power electronic circuits, and some new designs can be formed using those switching cells in various combinations. Using these switching cells, many power electronic circuits can be made modular, and the modeling and analysis become easier.},

In this paper, a modified version of the Butterworth filter that can handle nonstationary signals is presented.

abstract = {The operating region of modular multilevel converter (MMC) is limited by the maximum allowable voltage ripple of cells, which is associated with the arm energy variation. Injecting the controlled second-order harmonic component into the circulating current can reduce energy variation of arm and thus extend the operating region of MMC. Care must be taken, however that the second-order circulating current affects the arm current and inappropriately injected harmonic current may cause the arm current polarity change undesirably. Therefore, this paper first investigates and proposes the maximum allowable second-order circulating current for extending the operating region reliably and efficiently. The active and reactive power capability of MMC is further elaborated and illustrated in line with the maximum excess energy capability for two cases, running with (1) the original operating region and (2) the extended operating region. Finally, the P-Q diagrams for contingent operating conditions with faulty or disabled submodules are presented. Understanding unique shape and change of P-Q capability with credible submodule failure contingency should be crucial for planning MMC-HVDC lines, and determining the energy requirements and the level of redundancy in submodules properly in order to achieve the envisioned benefits of the new HVDC. The efficacy and accuracy of the research findings are validated for MMC-HVDC system using PSCAD/EMTDC.},

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become an attractive option for dc/ac conversion in many power system applications, in particular, for HVDC transmission. Due to its parallel arrangement of phase legs, the MMC is known to be a wye-configured architecture. In this paper, the equivalent delta formulation of the conventional wye architecture is introduced. The delta-configured MMC, enabled by series-stacking phase legs, is an alternative realization to the wye-configured MMC and has significantly different operating characteristics. The introduction of the delta MMC enables greater flexibility in converter voltage/current scaling for a given set of submodules, and may be an appealing option for dc/ac applications requiring a power tapoff from a high-voltage dc rail. The single-ended and differential delta topologies are derived, with the latter seen as the preferred topology due to its reduced energy-storage requirements. The principle of operation of the differential delta-configured MMC is described in detail. A dynamic controller is developed that regulates grid power injections while suppressing unwanted circulating ac currents. Comprehensive simulation results validate the differential delta MMC operation and the proposed control scheme.},

abstract = {Wind power plants (WPP) are for power system stability studies often represented with aggregated models where several wind turbines (WT) are aggregated into a single up-scaled model. The advantage is a reduction in the model complexity and the computational time, and for a number of study types the accuracy of the results has been found acceptable. A large WPP is, however, both modular and distributed over a large geographical area, and feasibility of aggregating the WTs, thus, have to be reassessed when new applications are introduced for WPPs. Here, the power oscillation damping capabilities are investigated for a WPP, which includes the full layout of the collector grid and where the WTs are represented individually. With this approach, the influence of the WT control in terms of impact on oscillatory modes is assessed for the WTs individually. The initial results encourage that park level control is possible. Time domain simulations support that each WT contribute to a common WPP response. Park level active and reactive power-based power oscillation damping controllers (POD) are designed and the positive damping contribution is demonstrated. Keeping the POD designs unchanged, the impact of WPP aggregation is investigated and it is shown that the level of WPP aggregation only has limited impact on the resulting modal damping. The study is based on a non-linear, dynamic model of the 3.6 MW Siemens Wind Power WT.},

abstract = {Up to now, in the development of power electronics systems, the reduction of the initial costs or the increase of the power density have been of primary concern. However, with increasing energy costs also the power conversion efficiency is gaining higher and higher importance. Accordingly, while maintaining high power density, an efficiency as high as possible must be obtained. In this paper the maximum attainable efficiency and the dependency of the efficiency limit on technological parameters is determined for single-phase PFC boost rectifiers. In a first step basic PFC boost rectifier topologies are briefly compared with regard to high efficiency and a dual-boost PFC rectifier with integral common-mode filtering is selected as basis for the investigations. Next, simple approximations of the technological limits of the system performance are calculated in the efficiencypower density plane. With this, the Feasible Performance Space and the reduction in power density which has to be accepted for increasing the efficiency are clarified, and the trade-off limit curve (Pareto Front) of a multi-objective, i.e. efficiency and power density design optimization is determined. Furthermore, a comprehensive numerical efficiency optimization is carried out which identifies an efficiency limit of 99.2{\{}{\%}{\}} for a 3.2kW system. The theoretical considerations are verified by experimental results from a laboratory prototype of the ultra-high efficiency system achieving 99.1{\{}{\%}{\}} efficiency at a power density of 1.1kW/din{\{}{\textless}{\}}sup{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}3{\{}{\textless}{\}}/sup{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}, as well as those firom an ultra-compact dual-boost PFC rectifier (95.8{\{}{\%}{\}}, 5.5kW/dn{\{}{\textless}{\}}sup{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}3{\{}{\textless}{\}}/sup{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}) and a very low switching freluency (3kHz) conventional PFC boost rectifier (96.7{\{}{\%}{\}}, 2kW/din{\{}{\textless}{\}}sup{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}3{\{}{\textless}{\}}/sup{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}). Finally, the sensitivity of the efficiency optimum with regard to various technological parameters is analyzed and an outlook on the further course of the research is given.},

abstract = {In 2003 the Roadmapping Initiative of the European Center of Power Electronics (ECPE) has been started based on a future vision of society in 2020 in order to define the future role of power electronics, and to identify technological barriers and prepare new technologies well in time. In the framework of this initiative a new mathematically supported approach for the roadmapping in power electronics has been developed. As described in this paper the procedure relies on a comprehensive mathematical modeling and subsequent multi-objective optimization of a converter system. The relationship between the technological base and the performance of the system then exists as a mathematical representation, whose optimization assures the best possible exploitation of the available degrees of freedom and technologies. Thus an objective Technology Node of a system is obtained, whereby physical limits are implicitly taken into account. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the system performance with regard to the technological base can be calculated directly and the internal interdependence of Performance Indices directly studied. Accordingly, the improvement in performance achievable by improvements in the technology base can be tested and assessed in advance. Moreover, different system concepts, i.e. circuit topologies, control procedures, etc. can be evaluated and directly compared with regard to achievable efficiency, power density and costs in the form of the associated Pareto Front which defines the boundary of the Feasible Performance Space. If the target performance lies outside the Pareto Envelope of known system concepts and state-of-the-art technologies, a new technology must be employed. The necessity of a technological leap, i.e. the introduction of a Disruptive Technology can thus be recognized at an early stage. This offers an excellent basis for effective roadmapping for various main application areas in power electronics.},

abstract = {In 2003 the Roadmapping Initiative of the European Center of Power Electronics (ECPE) has been started based on a future vision of society in 2020 in order to define the future role of power electronics, and to identify technological barriers and prepare new technologies well in time. In the framework of this initiative a new mathematically supported approach for the roadmapping in power electronics has been developed. As described in this paper the procedure relies on a comprehensive mathematical modeling and subsequent multi-objective optimization of a converter system. The relationship between the technological base and the performance of the system then exists as a mathematical representation, whose optimization assures the best possible exploitation of the available degrees of freedom and technologies. Thus an objective Technology Node of a system is obtained, whereby physical limits are implicitly taken into account. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the system performance with regard to the technological base can be calculated directly and the internal interdependence of Performance Indices directly studied. Accordingly, the improvement in performance achievable by improvements in the technology base can be tested and assessed in advance. Moreover, different system concepts, i.e. circuit topologies, control procedures, etc. can be evaluated and directly compared with regard to achievable efficiency, power density and costs in the form of the associated Pareto Front which defines the boundary of the Feasible Performance Space. If the target performance lies outside the Pareto Envelope of known system concepts and state-of-the-art technologies, a new technology must be employed. The necessity of a technological leap, i.e. the introduction of a Disruptive Technology can thus be recognized at an early stage. This offers an excellent basis for effective roadmapping for various main application areas in power electronics.},

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is an upcoming topology for high-power drive applications especially in the medium voltage range. This paper presents the design process of a holistic control system for a MMC to feed variable-speed drives. First, the design of the current control for the independent adjustment of several current components is derived from the analysis of the equivalent circuits. Second, the current and voltage components for balancing the energies in the arms of the MMC are identified systematically by the investigation of the transformed arm power components. These fundamentals lead to the design of the cascaded control structure, which allows the balancing task in the whole operating range of a three-phase machine. The control system ensures a dynamic balancing of the energies in the cells of the MMC at minimum necessary internal currents over the complete frequency range. Simultaneously, all other circulating current components are avoided to minimize current stress and additional voltage pulsations. The performance of the control system is finally validated by measurements on a low-voltage MMC prototype, which feeds a field-oriented controlled induction machine.},

This paper proposes the configuration of the MMC topology with redundant SMs and demonstrates the effects of active redundancies. The proposed configuration decreases the switching frequency per SM while reducing the SM capacitor voltage ripples. An analytical model for determining the SM capacitor voltage ripple and voltage dynamics is derived. The results from the analytical model are compared with the switching model for a 21-level MMC with five redundant (25 in total) SMs per arm. Experimental results based on a single-phase laboratory prototype with five SMs per arm and a single redundant cell further illustrate the operation and verify the derived mathematical model and simulation results.},

This paper presents an analysis of SM switching frequencies in staircase modulated MMCs and their correlation to the modulation index and load phase angle. A carrier based pulse-width modulation (CB-PWM) equivalent technique is also developed. The presented analysis demonstrates that CB-PWM techniques provide similar switching frequency with superior harmonic performance and improved voltage balancing characteristics at all modulation indices compared to staircase modulation.

abstract = {This letter studies single-input dc-dc converter topologies that are suitable to be expanded into their multiple-input converter version. The analysis is based on several assumptions, restrictions, and conditions, including the goal of minimizing the total number of components and the use of at least one forward-conducting bidirectional blocking switch in each input leg. These conditions may affect the outcome of the multiple-input converter synthesis and lead to different configurations from those suggested before in the literature. Although simultaneous power delivery from all sources is not required, it should be possible to independently control the power drained from each input with some degree of freedom. The letter lists four rules that must be observed in order to be able to realize a multiple-input converter from its single-input version. These rules are used to identify the only feasible input cell that complies with all assumptions and conditions. Unfeasible input cells are also shown. The letter also identifies some additional feasible input cells if some of the assumptions and conditions are relaxed. These input cells are used to suggest several multiple-input converter topologies. Among them, six topologies, including versions of the single-ended primary inductance converter and the Cuk converters, are introduced through their circuit schematic.},

Hence, it provides planners with an essential tool to evaluate downtime costs and decide technology deployments based on quantitative risk assessments by allowing to compare the effect that converter topologies and microgrid architecture choices have on availability. Conventional architectures with single-input converters and alternative configurations with multiple-input converters (MICs) are considered. Calculations yield that all microgrid configurations except those utilizing center converters achieve similar availability of 6-nines. Three converter topologies are used as representatives of many other circuits. These three benchmark circuits are the boost, the isolated SEPIC (ISEPIC), and the current-source half-bridge. Marginal availability differences are observed for different circuit topology choices, although architectures with MICs are more sensitive to this choice. MICs and, in particular, the ISEPIC, are identified as good compromise options for dc microgrids source interfaces.

Potential applications for advanced power distribution architectures include advanced micro-grid enabled smart grids, electric ships, and data centers.

Some commented relevant alternatives for any of these power architectures include ac and dc distribution systems. Although it is identified that dc architectures are more advantageous than ac power distribution systems in terms of efficiency, availability, flexibility, and components power density, dc systems present issues with fault detection and clearance. An option involving multiple-input multiple output converters that addressed these issues with dc architectures is commented in this paper. The discussion presents some suitable topologies for these converters including one derived from a multiple-input boost converter and another one realized from a multiple-input fly-back converter. In the proposed architectures multiple-input multiple-output converters are placed in key distribution nodes and act as "power routers" by freely controlling all input and output powers. These power routers allow to address issues related with fault detection and clearance in distributed power architectures through internal over current protection mechanisms.},

Mitigating strategies such as load shedding, addition of resistive loads, filters, or energy storage directly connected to the main bus, and control methods are investigated.

Then, steady-state analyses are made to show the merits of the proposed converter module. For closed-loop control design, the corresponding small-signal model is also derived. It is seen that, for higher power applications, more modules can be paralleled to increase the power rating and the dynamic performance. As an illustration, closed-loop control of a 450-W rating converter consisting of two paralleled modules with 24-V input and 200-V output is implemented for demonstration. Experimental results show that the modular high step-up boost converter can achieve an efficiency of 95.8{\%} approximately.},

One of the major{\$}\backslash{\$}nlimitations of the multilevel converters is the voltage unbalance{\$}\backslash{\$}nbetween different levels. The techniques to balance the voltage between{\$}\backslash{\$}ndifferent levels normally involve voltage clamping or capacitor charge{\$}\backslash{\$}ncontrol. There are several ways of implementing voltage balance in{\$}\backslash{\$}nmultilevel converters. Without considering the traditional magnetic{\$}\backslash{\$}ncoupled converters, this paper presents three multilevel voltage source{\$}\backslash{\$}nconverters: (1) diode-clamp, (2) flying-capacitors, and (3){\$}\backslash{\$}ncascaded-inverters with separate DC sources. The operating principle,{\$}\backslash{\$}nfeatures, constraints, and potential applications of these converters{\$}\backslash{\$}nare discussed},

abstract = {A broad class of problems in circuits, electromagnetics, and optics can be expressed as finding some parameters of a linear system with a specific type. This paper is concerned with studying this type of circuit using the available control techniques. It is shown that the underlying problem can be recast as a rank minimization problem that is NP-hard in general. In order to circumvent this difficulty, the circuit problem is slightly modified so that the resulting optimization becomes convex. This interesting result is achieved at the cost of complicating the structure of the circuit, which introduces a trade-off between the design simplicity and the implementation complexity. When it is strictly required to solve the original circuit problem, the elegant structure of the proposed rank minimization problem allows for employing a celebrated heuristic method to solve it efficiently.},

After studying the half-bridge structure, two soft-switching dc-dc converters are analyzed: one operating in zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) mode and the other in zero-current-switching (ZCS) mode. The ZVS converter can overcome the drawbacks of the original structure but is more complicated. The ZCS converter cannot operate at duty cycles below 0.5, but is simpler and more suitable for FC applications. Flexible choice of components, low losses, high efficiency, and modular converter possibility are all interesting characteristics of these converters. Their operation principle and characteristics are presented in this paper. Experimental results on 2 kW converters of each structure validate the theoretical analysis.},

Then, the mathematical analysis of PSC modulation forMMCis performed to identify thePWMharmonic characteristics of the output voltage and the circulating current. Moreover, influence of the carrier displacement angle between the upper and lower arms on these harmonics is also studied. Using this analysis, the optimum displacement angles are specified for the output voltage harmonicsminimization and the circulating current harmonics cancellation, respectively. The harmonic features of the line-to-line voltage and the dc-link current are also investigated. Moreover, an extension of the PSC modulation for MMC with full-bridge submodules is also proposed which can increase the equivalent switching frequency of the output voltage and circulat- ing current by two times compared with the conventional MMC.

abstract = {For a large multi-terminal HVDC system, it is important that a DC fault on a single branch does not cause significant disturbance to the operation of the healthy parts of the DC network. Some DC circuit breakers (DCCBs), e.g. mechanical type, have low cost and power loss, but have been considered unsuitable for DC fault protection and isolation in a multi-terminal HVDC system due to their long opening time. This paper proposes the use of additional DC passive components and novel converter control combined with mechanical DCCBs to ensure that the healthy DC network can continue to operate without disruption during a DC fault on one DC branch. Two circuit structures, using an additional DC reactor, and a reactor and capacitor combination, connected to the DC-link node in a radial HVDC system are proposed to ensure over-current risk at the converters connected to the healthy network is minimized before the isolation of the faulty branch by mechanical DCCBs. Active control of DC fault current by dynamically regulating the DC components of the converter arm voltages is proposed to further reduce the fault arm current. Simulation of a radial three-terminal HVDC system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A small-signal model based on dynamic phasors is introduced which takes into consideration the dynamics of internal variables such as circulating arm currents which have a tendency for a large second harmonic component and module capacitor voltage ripple, which has other harmonic components. The small-signal model is validated by comparison with the electromagnetic transient simulation of a detailed model. It is shown that the use of an active circulating current suppressing scheme can effectively improve the damping of internal harmonic modes in comparison with a passive filter used for the same purpose. The damping of internal harmonic modes is shown to be significantly impacted by the gains of the MMC's outer loop controller but is less sensitive to the ac system strength or the gain of the phase locked loop. A larger arm resistance also increases the damping of these internal modes.},

abstract = {The circulating current in phase legs is an inherent phenomenon of modular multilevel converters (MMCs). The circulating current affects various aspects of MMC performance, such as power losses, capacitor voltage ripples, and the required current rating of semiconductors. Existing circulating current control methods can improve MMC performance in one aspect, but they may not implement the optimal performance in various aspects. Analytically analyzing how circulating current control affects MMC performance is essential. This paper proposes an improved steady-state analysis method that considers circulating current control. The influence of circulating current control is included by considering the effects of the second-harmonic component on reference voltages. Explicit analytical expressions for various electrical quantities can be derived, and the analytical calculation curves of some MMC performance indexes concerned under varying second-harmonic reference voltages can be obtained. Accordingly, the effects of circulating current control on MMC performance can be concluded, where a theoretical foundation for the accurate design of MMC parameters is provided. In addition, the obtained analytical calculation curves can be used to evaluate different circulating current control targets and find appropriate control targets to comprehensively improve MMC performance. Both simulation and experimental results verify the validity of the proposed steady-state analysis method and the corresponding conclusions.},

abstract = {A high-voltage direct current system using modular multilevel converter (MMC-HVDC) is a potential candidate for grid integration of renewable energy over long distances. The dc-link fault is an issue MMC-HVDC must deal with, especially for the nonpermanent faults when using overhead lines. This paper proposed a protection scheme to implement fast fault clearance and automatic recovery for nonpermanent faults on dc lines. By employing double thyristor switches, the freewheeling effect of diodes is eliminated and the dc-link fault current is allowed to freely decay to zero. Then, the dc arc can be naturally extinguished and the insulation on the short-circuit point can be restored. The thyristor switches convert the dc-link fault into an ac short circuit of the ac grid through MMC arms. The ac short-circuit current can be cleared simply by turning off all thyristor switches. Since circuit breakers are not tripped during fault clearance, MMC can immediately and automatically rebuild the dc-link voltage and restart power transmission. Simulation results using PSCAD/EMTDC have verified the validity of the proposed protection scheme.},

abstract = {Owing to the direct coupling between the input and output of matrix converter, the abnormal power supply could disturb the output voltage easily. In this study, three modulation strategies for matrix converter based on mathematical construction are proposed under unbalanced input voltage conditions. The strategies are developed based on the construction of the rectifier and inverter modulation vectors in three different ways. By regulating appropriately the modulation index of inverter vector, the output voltages of matrix converter can maintain sinusoidal and balanced. The different rectifier vectors result in different input currents. Moreover, the analytical solutions for input currents with the three methods are presented, and the approximated solutions are derived to estimate their low-order spectrums. Comprehensive comparisons among the three methods are made in the aspects of the complexity of realisation, voltage-transfer capability and input current quality. Simulation and experimental results verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

This paper theoretically investigates how voltage-balancing control influences the switching frequency in MMC.

abstract = {Ideally, the inner (the upper or lower arm) current of a modular multilevel converter (MMC) is ideally assumed to be the sum of a dc component and an ac component of the fundamental frequency. However, as ac current flows through the submodule (SM) capacitors, the capacitor voltages fluctuate with time. Consequently, the inner current is usually distorted and the peak/RMS value of it is increased compared with the theoretical value. The increased currents will increase power losses and may threaten the safe operation of the power devices and capacitors. This paper proposes a closed-loop method for suppression of the inner current in an MMC. This method is very simple and is implemented in a stationary frame, and no harmonic extraction algorithm is needed. Hence, it can be applied to single-phase or three-phase MMCs. Besides, this method does not influence the balancing of the SM capacitor voltages. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method can suppress the peak and RMS values of the inner currents dramatically.},

abstract = {In this paper, an improved pulse width modulation (PWM) method for chopper-cell (or half-bridge)based modular multilevel converters (MMCs) is proposed. This method can generate an output voltage with maximally 2N+1 (where N is the number of submodules in the upper or lower arm of MMC) levels, which is as great as that of the carrier-phase-shifted PWM (CPSPWM) method. However, no phase-shifted carrier is needed. Compared with the existing submodule unified pulse width modulated (SUPWM) method, the level number of the output voltage is almost doubled and the height of the step in the staircase voltage is reduced by 50{\{}{\%}{\}}. Meanwhile, the equivalent switching frequency in the output voltage is twice that of the conventional SUPWM method. All these features lead to much reduced harmonic content in the output voltage. What is more, the voltages of the submodule capacitors can be well balanced without any close-loop voltage balancing controllers which are mandatory in the CPSPWM schemes. Simulation and experimental results on a MMC-based inverter show validity of the proposed method.},

On this basis, the nearest level control is applied as the modulation method and an optimized control strategy based on the dynamic redundancy for the modular multilevel converter (MMC) is proposed. One of the main innovations is that the reference value of the capacitor voltage is derived according to the maximum output voltage of each converter arm and the safety margin which can be adjusted artificially. Unlike previous strategies, the redundancy can be adjusted dynamically, and the utilization ratio of the submodules can be effectively improved. In addition, the capacitor voltage and the inner stress are reduced, and the fault ride-through capability of the system can be enhanced. In particular, the strategy under abnormal operating conditions is also detailed in this paper. A model of two-terminal MMC-high-voltage direct current system is built in PSCAD/EMTDC, and the simulation result proves the validity and the feasibility of the proposed strategy.},

abstract = {Large-scale grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems significantly contribute to worldwide renewable energy growth and penetration, which has inspired the application of cascaded modular multilevel converters due to their unique features such as modular structures, enhanced energy harvesting capability, scalability and so on. However, power distribution and control in the cascaded PV system faces tough challenge on output voltage over-modulation when considering the varied and non-uniform solar energy on segmented PV arrays. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a decoupled active and reactive power control strategy to enhance system operation performance. The relationship between output voltage components of each module and power generation is analyzed with the help of a newly derived vector diagram which illustrates the proposed power distribution principle. On top of this, an effective control system including active and reactive components extraction, voltage distribution and synthesization, is developed to achieve independent active and reactive power distribution and mitigate the aforementioned issue. Finally, a 3 MW, 12 kV PV system with the proposed control strategy is modeled and simulated in MATLAB and PSIM co-simulation platform. A downscaled PV system including two cascaded 5kW converters with proposed control strategy is also implemented in the laboratory. Simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy for large-scale grid-connected cascaded PV systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, heat extractors are embedded into the magnetic materials of the integrated power electronics passive modules. The optimum volume of heat-extracting material may slightly reduce the amount of electromagnetic energy that is processed, but more efficient heat removal yields higher allowable levels of both electromagnetic stress and losses per unit volume in the remaining material. Without influencing the electromagnetic performance, heat extractors provide the potential to improve the power density of passive modules. This paper introduces the mechanism of heat extractors into passive power electronics modules. Theoretical thermal models and simulation are used to investigate factors influencing the module performance and the improvement on power density. Prototypes are built for experimental investigation. The experimental results show great improvement of power density by the application of heat extraction technology.

abstract = {Voltage source inverters (VSIs) are usually used for all kinds of distributed generation interfaces in a microgrid. It is the microgrid's superiority to power the local loads continuously when the utility fails. When in islanded mode, the voltage and frequency of the microgrid are determined by the VSIs; therefore the power quality can be deteriorated under unbalanced and non-linear loads. A voltage unbalance and harmonics compensation strategy for the VSIs in islanded microgrid is proposed in this study. This method is implemented in a single synchronous reference frame (SRF) and is responsible for both the voltage unbalance and harmonic compensation. Furthermore, the virtual impedance loop is modified to improve the compensation effect. The impedance model of the VSI is built to explain the compensation ability of the proposed strategy. The whole control system mainly includes power droop controllers, a modified virtual impedance loop and inner SRF-based voltage unbalance and harmonics compensators. The proposed strategy is demonstrated in detail and validated with simulations and experiments.},

abstract = {Modular multilevel converters offer several benefits, such as high scalability and power quality, which are particularly advantageous for high-voltage dc transmission systems. However, the control of such converters is very challenging due to the number of control objectives to be achieved simultaneously. The input and output currents must be controlled at their own references, and these references must be properly generated in order to keep the average capacitor voltage constant. The circulating current can be controlled either to minimize losses or to reduce capacitor voltage ripple. Additionally, the capacitor voltage must be kept balanced among cells during the converter operation. In this paper, a model with four independent dynamical components of the arm currents, which also considers the effect of ac and dc systems, is proposed. The proposed model facilitates the dynamical analysis of currents and simplifies the design and implementation of current controllers. Analysis of the proposed current model and experimental results, which confirm the performance of the designed controllers, is shown.},

abstract = {Modular multilevel converters have several attractive features such as a modular structure, high voltage capability and scalability, excellent quality of the output voltage waveforms, as well as, low expense for redundancy. However, the main drawback of this converter is the complexity of the control system due to the multiple control objectives which include the input, output, circulating current and the capacitor voltages. Several control schemes for the capacitor voltages have been proposed, being usually divided into the control of the average voltage and the balancing of the capacitor voltages among the submodules and among the arms. These control schemes can effectively control the capacitor voltage when the reference is the same for all arms, but they cannot manage arbitrary voltage references when each arm capacitor voltage must be controlled independently as required, for example, to achieve maximum power point tracking in photovoltaic applications. This paper proposes a control strategy for a modular multilevel converter capable to manage the average capacitor voltage of each arm independently. The proposed scheme is based on a decomposition of the energy of the arms in different components, according to theirs symmetries. Results validating the performance of the proposed control scheme are shown and the impact on the output current is also discussed. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2015 IEEE.},

In particular, the type D wind turbine configuration - containing a full power converter - appears set up to increase market share in the next five years. If projections of these findings are realised wind turbines without a power converter could be reduced to a niche market as soon as 2013. The paper refers these findings to, among other reasons, the increasingly more strict technical requirements of the grid operation codes.

Home appliances are one of the main loads in such dc-based nanogrids. In this paper, the design and optimization of an appliance for operation in a dc-based nanogrid is detailed.

abstract = {Electrical power generation is changing dramatically across the world because of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to introduce mixed energy sources. The power network faces great challenges in transmission and distribution to meet demand with unpredictable daily and seasonal variations. Electrical Energy Storage (EES) is recognized as underpinning technologies to have great potential in meeting these challenges, whereby energy is stored in a certain state, according to the technology used, and is converted to electrical energy when needed. However, the wide variety of options and complex characteristic matrices make it difficult to appraise a specific EES technology for a particular application. This paper intends to mitigate this problem by providing a comprehensive and clear picture of the state-of-the-art technologies available, and where they would be suited for integration into a power generation and distribution system. The paper starts with an overview of the operation principles, technical and economic performance features and the current research and development of important EES technologies, sorted into six main categories based on the types of energy stored. Following this, a comprehensive comparison and an application potential analysis of the reviewed technologies are presented.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the stability of offshore wind farms integration through a modular multilevel converter-based high-voltage dc (MMC-HVdc) transmission system. Resonances or instability phenomena have been reported in between wind farms and MMC-HVdc systems. They are arguably originated due to interactions between the MMC and the wind power inverters. However, the nature of these interactions is neither well understood nor reported in the literature. In this paper, the impedance-based analytical approach is applied to analyze the stability and to predict the phase margin of the interconnected system. For that, analytical impedance models of a three-phase MMC in a compensated modulation case and a direct modulation case are separately derived using the small-signal frequency domain method. Moreover, the impedance models of the MMC take the circulating current control into account. The derived impedance models are then verified by comparing the frequency responses of the analytical model with the impedance measured in a nonlinear time-domain simulation model developed in MATLAB. The results show that the potential resonances or instability of the interconnected system can be readily predicted through the Nyquist diagrams. In addition, the analysis indicates that the circulating current control of the MMC has a significant impact on the stability of the interconnected system. Finally, the time-domain simulations validate the theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {As a key component in the wind turbine system, power electronic converter and its power semiconductors suffer from adverse power loadings related to environment, and are proven to have certain failure rates. Therefore, correct lifetime estimation of wind power converter is crucial for the reliability improvement and also for cost reduction of wind power technology. Unfortunately, the existing lifetime estimation methods for the power electronic converter are not yet suitable in the wind power application, because the comprehensive mission profiles are not well specified and included. Consequently, a relative more advanced approach is proposed in this paper, which is based on the loading and strength analysis of devices and takes into account different time constants of the thermal behaviors in power converter. With the established methods for loading profile generation and lifetime estimation, more detailed information for the reliability performance of wind power converter can be obtained.},

abstract = {The traditional ac power system is challenged by the increased amount of distributed energy resources. Enormous changes and investments are necessary in order to achieve an ac smart grid capable of coping with the challenges introduced. In dc, solutions seem to be more straightforward since most of the distributed energy sources and most of the loads connected to the low voltage grid operate with dc. For this reason, dc distribution systems should be considered as an alternative with significant potential. Nevertheless, nowadays research is mainly focused on local dc nano- and microgrids. This paper introduces relevant aspects related to dc distribution networks. A wide field of opportunities and challenges are briefly exposed},

abstract = {DC has several advantages over ac. In relation with the changes needed in todays ac power system to deal with dominating amounts of fluctuating renewable energy, it seems wise to consider dc as an alternative. One of the problems with introducing dc grids is the lack of availability of dc devices. DC ready devices that work on both - ac and dc - would simplify a smooth introduction of dc there, where it has its biggest advantage. This is especially interesting for newly built infrastructure, e.g. in developing countries with bad ac infrastructure, but also for upgrading the power of existing ac cables when needed. As most ac devices today already have dc/dc converters inside, the changes are not as big as one might assume. In this paper the rectification stage and power factor correction is looked at in detail and it is shown that in most cases there is no need for re-dimensioning of components to make devices dc ready. Other important points are subject of ongoing research as are dc microgrids in general.},

The novelty of the active snubber cell is that, it provides ZVT turn-on and zero-voltage switching (ZVS) turn-off for the main switch without extra current or voltage stress. Auxiliary switch is turned on near zero-current switching without additional voltage stress and turns off near ZVS. The input line current and output voltage are controlled by the proposed power factor correction (PFC) converter in very wide load range. This PFC converter has ease of control as well as a simple structure. In this study, detailed steady-state analysis of proposed converter is presented, and this theoretical analysis is verified exactly by 400-V, 1.5-kW and 100-kHz prototype. This prototype has total efficiency of 97.3- and 0.9996 power factor with input line sinusoidal current at full load.},

A detailed classification and review of various noise mitigation techniques currently available in literature are presented. It is believed that the classification and review of the conducted EMI mitigation techniques presented in this paper would be useful to SMPS researchers and designers.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of optimizing space vector PWM (SVM) for interleaved, parallel-connected, three-phase voltage source converters to reduce total harmonic distortion (THD) of the total line current. A systematic approach is presented for designing hybrid SVM schemes involving multiple sequences, including those based on active state division, and different phase shifts to reduce current ripple. First, the effect of different phase shifts on the current ripple is investigated and it is shown that using standard phase shifts yields performance close to optimal. Second, a zone-division plot is generated based on all sequence-phase shift combinations. The plot shows spatial regions within a sector where a certain sequence-phase shift combination results in the lowest rms current ripple in one switching period, and thus represents the optimal hybrid scheme. Lastly, simplified, easy-to-implement quasi-optimal SVM schemes are derived from the zone-division plot based on specific application requirements, and their performances are compared with the optimal scheme. The application of the proposed approach to a two-converter case is discussed in detail. A simple, quasi-optimal SVM scheme is proposed for grid-connected applications with analytical and experimental results confirming significant reduction in current THD. Finally, extension to three- and four-converter cases is discussed.},

Therefore, the design and the realization of ultra-flat magnetic components with PCB-integrated cores is detailed in this paper. The presented multi-objective design procedure determines the inductor and/or transformer setup optimal with respect to minimal losses and/or minimal footprint; for this purpose, the proposed design procedure considers all required electrical, magnetical, and geometrical parameters of the magnetic component.

Consequently, low power converters will move to multimegahertz frequencies with a resulting reduction in capacitor and inductor values by factors of 5 and 20, respectively. Values required at 10 MHz, for a low power buck converter, are estimated at 130 nH and 0.6 uF, compatible with the integration of magnetics onto silicon and the concept of power supply-on-chip (PSOC). A review of magnetics-on-silicon shows that inductance values of 20 to 40nH/mm{\{}{\textless}{\}}sup{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}2{\{}{\textless}{\}}/sup{\{}{\textgreater}{\}} can be achieved for winding resistances less than 1{\{}{\&}{\}}Omega;. A 1-{\{}{\&}{\}}mu;H inductance can be achieved at 5 MHz with dc resistance of 1{\{}{\&}{\}}Omega; and a Q of four. Thin film magnetic materials, compatible with semiconductor processing, offer power loss density that is lower than ferrite by a factor of 5 at 10 MHz. Other data reported includes, lowest dc resistance values of 120 m{\{}{\&}{\}}Omega; for an inductance of 120 nH; highest Q of 15 for an inductance of 350 nH and a current of 1 A for a 1- {\{}{\&}{\}}mu;H inductor. Future technology challenges include reducing losses using high resistivity, laminated magnetic materials, and increasing current carrying capability using high aspect-ratio, electroplated copper conductors. Compatible technologies are available in the power switch, control, and packaging space. Integrated capacitor technology is still a long-term challenge with maximum reported values of 400 nF/cm{\{}{\textless}{\}}sup{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}2{\{}{\textless}{\}}/sup{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}.},

abstract = {Multilevel converters, such as the modular multilevel converter (MMC) or the alternate arm converter (AAC), rely on charged capacitors in their cells to generate their AC voltage waveform. Since the cell capacitors are physically large and occupy approximately half the cell volume, their capacitance must be kept minimal while limiting the voltage fluctuation caused by the current passing periodically through these capacitors. This study proposes a mathematical model which estimates the energy deviation for the stacks of both the MMC and the AAC during steady-state operation under any power factor and for AC voltage magnitude fluctuation of up to ±10{\{}{\%}{\}}. The analysis is then used to calculate the minimum size for the cell capacitors in order to keep their voltage fluctuation within set boundaries for both topologies. The results show that the MMC requires 39 kJ/MVA of capacitive energy storage under sinusoidal modulation but this reduces with triplen injection modulation. The AAC has a lower requirement for storage in its cells of 11 kJ/MVA but the AAC has a six-pulse DC current ripple which requires a filter estimated to have a further 33{\{}{\%}{\}} capacitive storage.},

abstract = {A new transformerless four-leg topology is suggested for shunt compensation, the modular multilevel converters (MMC) based on the half-bridge converters, to achieve higher performance as a STATCOM in a distorted and unbalanced medium-voltage large-current (MV-LC) system. Further, an extended MMC (EMMC) is proposed in order to manage more accurate compensation for high-power applications. Both proposals can be controlled for various purposes such as reactive power and unbalance compensation, voltage regulation, and harmonic cancellation. Moreover, related control strategies are also suggested for both the MMC and the EMMC to ensure that the source-end three-phase currents are sinusoidal and balanced. Also, the dc-link capacitors of the half-bridge converters are regulated. One interesting application for the EMMC-based STATCOM could be the improvement in power quality and performance of the electrified railway traction power supply system. Both the MMC- and the EMMC-based STATCOM along with their proposed control strategies were simulated; further, to verify the suggestions, these proposals were also implemented on a 30-kVA modular laboratory prototype. Experiments and simulations confirm the predefined objectives.},

Our focus is on how technological change can be channeled to address the critical challenges of our time and how we can shape the new and emerging technologies and systems to address these challenges. We include a list of basic technology advances that will, within the next ten years, underpin a large range of application technologies. We then identify some of the critical issues facing society, such as urbanization, water, and climate change, and discuss how the convergence of underpinning technologies can be shaped to address these issues. While the paths of technological change cannot always be predicted and impacts are highly uncertain, there are some clearly emerging trends, which point to real possibilities of steering technology in the direction of addressing critical societal issues.},

To control the MMC-HVDC system properly, the ac current, circulating current, and submodule (SM) capacitor voltage are taken into consideration. The existing MPC methods for the MMC-HVDC system utilize weighting factors to configure the cost function in combinations of the SM capacitor voltage balancing algorithm, ac current control, and circulating current control. Because all combinations of the switch states are considered in order to minimize the cost function, their possible combinations increase geometrically according to the increase of the level of the MMC, which is a significant disadvantage. This paper proposes a new MPC method with a reduced number of states for ac current control, circulating current control, and the SM capacitor voltage-balancing algorithm. The proposed cost functions are divided into three types according to their control purposes. Each cost function determines the minimum number of states for controlling the ac current, circulating current, and SM capacitor voltage. The efficacy of the proposed controlling method is verified through simulation results using PSCAD/EMTDC.},

Under balanced voltage conditions, only negative-sequence circulating currents exist. Consequently, the conventional method has considered only negative-sequence circulating currents in MMC. However, under unbalanced voltage conditions, there are positive-sequence circulating currents, zero-sequence circulating currents, and negative-sequence circulating currents in MMC. Thus, under unbalanced voltage conditions, a control method should consider all of these components. This study adopts a dual vector current controller as an ac-side current controller to reduce the ac-side active power ripple under unbalanced voltage.

To control an MMC-HVDC system properly, the ac current, circulating current, and submodule (SM) capacitor voltage are considered. The ac-side current is a fundamental frequency component, and the circulating current is a double-line frequency component. Existing control methods control the ac current and circulating current by separating each component. However, the existing methods have a disadvantage in that the ac-side current must be separated into the positive and negative sequences for control under an unbalanced voltage condition. The circulating current consists of not only negative-sequence components but also positive- and zero-sequence components under an unbalanced voltage condition. Therefore, an additional control method is necessary to consider the positive- and zero-sequence components of the circulating current. The proposed control method has the advantage of controlling not only the ac-side current of the MMC but also the circulating current without separating each of the current components to control each arm current of the MMC. In addition, it can stably control the positive- and zero-sequence components of the circulating current under the unbalanced voltage condition.},

abstract = {To fully utilize second-life batteries on the grid system, a hybrid battery scheme needs to be considered for several reasons: the uncertainty over using a single source supply chain for second-life batteries, the differences in evolving battery chemistry and battery configuration by different suppliers to strive for greater power levels, and the uncertainty of degradation within a second-life battery. Therefore, these hybrid battery systems could have widely different module voltage, capacity, and initial state of charge and state of health. In order to suitably integrate and control these widely different batteries, a suitable multimodular converter topology and an associated control structure are required. This paper addresses these issues proposing a modular boost-multilevel buck converter based topology to integrate these hybrid second-life batteries to a grid-tie inverter. Thereafter, a suitable module-based distributed control architecture is introduced to independently utilize each converter module according to its characteristics. The proposed converter and control architecture are found to be flexible enough to integrate widely different batteries to an inverter dc link. Modeling, analysis, and experimental validation are performed on a single-phase modular hybrid battery energy storage system prototype to understand the operation of the control strategy with different hybrid battery configurations.},

abstract = {The use of ex-transportation battery system (i.e. second life EV/HEV batteries) in grid applications is an emerging field of study. A hybrid battery scheme offers a more practical approach in second life battery energy storage systems because battery modules could be from different sources/ vehicle manufacturers depending on the second life supply chain and have different characteristics e.g. voltage levels, maximum capacity and also different levels of degradations. Recent research studies have suggested a dc-side modular multilevel converter topology to integrate these hybrid batteries to a grid-tie inverter. Depending on the battery module characteristics, the dc-side modular converter can adopt different modes such as boost, buck or boost-buck to suitably transfer the power from battery to the grid. These modes have different switching techniques, control range, different efficiencies, which give a system designer choice on operational mode. This paper presents an analysis and comparative study of all the modes of the converter along with their switching performances in detail to understand the relative advantages and disadvantages of each mode to help to select the suitable converter mode. Detailed study of all the converter modes and thorough experimental results based on a multi-modular converter prototype based on hybrid batteries has been presented to validate the analysis.},

This work introduces the capacitance value of the cell capacitors as a parameter uncertainty for making the system performance robust with unknown constant parameters. It may be used for predictive control, condition monitoring for capacitors and diagnosis check for capacitor health. Additionally, a Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) technique for modular multilevel converter has been explored. The PWM technique is performed using carrier-based Level-Shifted PWM (LS-PWM) strategy. It does not necessitate the calculation of duty cycles, and can be easily implemented in a DSP. By using the PWM technique, harmonics in the phase voltage is shifted to twice the switching frequency. Theoretical analysis is included in the paper for showing stability and convergence of the proposed observer. Analytical expressions are verified by simulation and experimental results.},

abstract = {Since the introduction of the first power module by Semikron in 1975, many innovations have been made to improve the thermal, electrical, and mechanical performance of power modules. These innovations in packaging technology focus on the enhancement of the heat dissipation and thermal cycling capability of the modules. Thermal cycles, caused by varying load and environmental operating conditions, induce high mechanical stress in the interconnection layers of the power module due to the different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), leading to fatigue and growth of microcracks in the bonding materials. As a result, the lifetime of power modules can be severely limited in practical applications. Furthermore, to reduce the size and weight of converters, the semiconductors are being operated at higher junction temperatures. Higher temperatures are especially of great interest for use of wide-?bandgap materials, such as SiC and GaN, because these materials leverage their material characteristics, particularly at higher temperatures. To satisfy these tightened requirements, on the one hand, conventional power modules, i.e., direct bonded Cu (DBC)-based systems with bond wire contacts, have been further improved. On the other hand, alternative packaging techniques, e.g., chip embedding into printed circuit boards (PCBs) and power module packaging based on the selective laser melting (SLM) technique, have been developed, which might constitute an alternative to conventional power modules in certain applications.},

abstract = {In an onshore horizontal axis wind turbine, generator and converter are usually in the nacelle on the top of the tower, while the grid step-up transformer is placed at the bottom. Electric power is transmitted down through flexible cables of high current rating which are expensive and can suffer from large I2 R loss. An offshore wind turbine usually has to include the step-up transformer in the nacelle. This adds significantly to the mechanical loading of the tower even new designs aim to reduce the transformer size and weight. In either case, a transformer-less, high voltage, high reliability generating unit for nacelle installation would be an attractive technology for large wind turbines. This study presents a power electronic solution based on a permanent magnet generator design. A multilevel cascaded voltage source converter is developed to synthesize a high sinusoidal output voltage. The dc link voltages of inverter modules are balanced by rectifiers fed from isolated generator coils while the inverter switching strategy equalizes the power sharing between the modules. The switching strategy also reduces the low order harmonics to constrain the sizing of the dc link capacitors. The modulating effect between the ac and dc sides of the inverter is taken into account.

The LVDC distribution is a novel approach to public electricity distribution, and a research site is set up to enable comprehensive studies concerning the LVDC distribution. Because the customers in the LVDC system are supplied with customer-end inverters (CEI), CM and RF EMI generated by the CEIs have to be analyzed. To this end, common-mode currents in the DC network and the customer-end networks are studied by on-site measurements. The objective is to determine whether there are disturbances that exceed the requirements of the standards or whether the CM current could cause safety issues in the converter-fed user-end network. In the DC network, the effect of the CM current on the feasibility of power line communication (PLC) in a DC network is analyzed. Finally, RF disturbances are measured and discussed.},

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter (MMC), originally proposed by Professor Marquardt, has made it practical to realize converters with ratings up to 1000 MW by using standard components developed for variable speed drives. With the power electronics packed into individual submodules, realizing a converter where the ac and dc voltages are under direct control and have very little distortion appears to be ideal; although there have been several papers published covering the design considerations required to ensure these converters operate correctly from an academic perspective, the method specifying the design of a fully rated MMC, where several hundred submodules may be required for each valve to meet all conditions in service has not been discussed. This paper outlines a procedure for calculating the values of the transformer turns ratio, the transformer reactance, and the valve reactance before considering how the ripple that appears on the submodule voltage affects the operating performance of the converter. This ripple limits the submodules from being able to fully use their capability, so the principal operators that affect the ripple voltage are considered. The main independent variables available are the submodule capacitor value, the number of submodules per valve, and the average capacitor voltage setting, which is set as a servo demand within the control. All these inputs have an effect on all aspects of the converter performance and so must be set together while considering other system variables such as the variation in the ac voltage.},

abstract = {At present, power supply systems all over the world are facing challenging situations where they have to be extremely flexible, reliable and expandable. Due to the growing proportion of distributed and renewable energy sources, existing grids have to be revised. Power electronic inverters are the grid interfaces for energy converting systems and a key component to control and manage the energy systems operation. To fulfill the requirements for tomorrow's energy systems, new concepts for flexible and adaptable inverter design are needed. In this paper an innovative concept for future oriented power system integration - the modular inverter design - is presented for three phase inverters. The introduced concept offers the required flexibility and adaptability for modern power supply systems. Modularity supports fast and simple customization, while all inverter components still can be manufactured in mass production. Using up-to-date technologies and the introduced advanced inverter concept; modular, flexible, reliable and cost-effective power supply structures can be built with less effort in design and maintenance. Furthermore, modular systems can be changed, rescaled and expanded even after implementation. The proposed design approach proved its strengths in a laboratory test installation. Results of test runs are given at the end if this paper.},

An analytical model for the phase-shifted PWM is proposed to design the current control gains. Two phase-shifted PWMmethods named as one-cell and all-cells update methods are compared theoretically and experimentally. The all-cells update method can reduce the inherent time delay, thus resulting in a faster and more stable system response than the one-cell update method.},

The cluster-balancing control using the MAF is better in transient performance than that using the LPF. A three-phase downscaled SSBC-based D-STATCOM rated at 150 V and 10 kVA is designed, constructed, and tested to verify the ZVRT capability under the severest single-, two-, and three-phase voltage sags with a voltage depth of 100{\{}{\%}{\}}.

The mode of " internal modularity + external modularity" exerts obvious and positive effects on product innovation of Haier: shortening life cycle of product innovation, reducing development cost, promoting diversification, enhancing reliability, increasing market competitive capability. Meanwhile, the mode also possibly hinders the systematic innovation and makes new product imitated easily, leading enterprises to fall into the situation of homogenization competition.

abstract = {In most power electronics converters, the overall volume is mainly determined by the number of parts and the size of passive components. Integrated magnetics and planar magnetics techniques, therefore, have been an excellent option in order to reduce the counts and the size of magnetic components, hereby increasing the power density of converters. In this paper, a new planar-integrated magnetics (PIM) module for a phase-shift plus duty-cycle-controlled hybrid bidirectional dc{\{}{\&}{\}}{\{}{\#}{\}}x2013;dc converter is proposed, which assembles one boost inductor and two transformers into an E-I-E core geometry, reducing the number of parts, the total volume of converter, as well as the total core loss of the magnetic components. AC losses in the windings and leakage inductance of the transformers are kept low by interleaving the primary and secondary turns of the transformers. To verify the validity of the design approach and theoretical analysis, a laboratory prototype employing the PIM module is implemented for a fuel cell application with 20{\{}{\&}{\}}{\{}{\#}{\}}x2013;40-V input voltage and 400-V output voltage. Detailed results from the experimental comparisons demonstrate that the PIM module is fully functional and electromagnetically equivalent to the discrete magnetics and a significant reduction of size can be achieved by using the PIM module.},

DC power systems have been discussed as a re-sult of the introduction of renewable, small-scale power generation units. Also, telecommunication power systems featuring UPS prop-erties might benefit from a broader introduction of dc power sys-tems. Droop control is utilized to distribute the load between the source converters. In order to make the loading of the source con-verters equal, in per unit, the voltage control algorithm for each converter has to be designed to act similar. The dc side capac-itor of each converter, needed for filtering, is also determined as a consequence. The root locus is investigated for varying dc bus impedance. It is found that the risk of entering converter over-mod-ulation is a stronger limitation than stability, at least for reasonable dc bus cable parameters. The stationary and dynamic properties during load variations are also investigated.},

abstract = {Fuel cell stacks produce a DC output with a 2:1 variation in output voltage from no-load to full-load. The output voltage of each fuel cell is about 0.4 V at full-load, and several of them are connected in series to construct a stack. An example 100 V fuel cell stack consists of 250 cells in series and to produce 300 V at full-load requires 750 cells stacked in series. Since fuel cells actively convert the supplied fuel to electricity, each cell requires proper distribution of fuel, humidification, coupled with water/thermal management needs. With this added complexity, stacking more cells in series decreases the reliability of the system. For example, in the presence of bad or malperforming cell/cells in a stack, uneven heating coupled with variations in cell voltages may occur. Continuous operation under these conditions may not be possible or the overall stack output power is severely limited. In this paper, a modular fuel cell powered by a modular DC-DC converter is proposed. The proposed concept electrically divides the fuel cell stack into various sections, each powered by a DC-DC converter. The proposed modular fuel cell powered by modular DC-DC converter eliminates many of these disadvantages, resulting in a fault tolerant system. A design example is presented for a 150-W, three-section fuel cell stack and DC-DC converter topology. Experimental results obtained on a 150-W, three-section proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack powered by a modular DC-DC converter are discussed.},

abstract = {A modular power electronic converter, with a cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter, has been proposed as the grid interface for a large direct-drive wind turbine generator. The present study is to investigate the potential and requirement of fault-tolerant operation in such a system. As each module is connected to isolated generator coils, tolerance to a module or coil fault is possible if the affected module can be bypassed, whereas the control of the healthy modules can be adjusted accordingly. A boost rectifier scheme on the machine side of the power conversion stage has been developed for this purpose, featuring control of the coil current without measuring the electromotive force. A coordinated dc-link voltage controller has been developed, which can rapidly raise the dc-link voltage of the remaining modules to compensate for the loss of a module while ignoring the ripple in the dc link due to low-frequency inverter switching. The ability of the resultant system to tolerate module faults has been demonstrated on a small-scale laboratory prototype.},

abstract = {This paper studies the possibility of building a Modular Multilevel Converter (M2C) using Silicon Carbide (SiC) switches. The main focus is on a theoretical investigation of the conduction losses of such a converter and a comparison to a corresponding converter with silicon insulated gate bipolar transistors. Both SiC BJTs and JFETs are considered and compared in order to choose the most suitable technology. One of the sub-modules of a down-scaled 10 kVA prototype M2C is replaced with a sub-module with SiC JFETs without anti-parallel diodes. It is shown that diode-less operation is possible with the JFETs conducting in the negative direction, leaving the possibility to use the body diode during the switching transients. Experimental waveforms for the SiC sub-module verify the feasibility during normal steady-state operation. The loss estimation shows that a 300 MW M2C for high-voltage direct current transmission would potentially have an efficiency of approximately 99,8 {\{}{\%}{\}} if equipped with future 3.3 kV 1.2 kA SiC JFETs.},

New modular multilevel converters (MMCs) are expected to supersede two- and three-level VSC-based technologies for HVDC applications due to their recognized advantages in terms of scalability, performance, and efficiency. The computational burden introduced by detailed modeling of MMC-HVDC systems in electromagnetic-transients (EMT)-type programs complicates the study of transients especially when these systems are integrated into a large network. This paper presents a novel average-value model (AVM) for efficient and accurate representation of a detailed MMC-HVDC system. It also develops a detailed 401-level MMC-HVDC model for validating the AVM and studies the performance of both models when integrated into a large 400-kV transmission system in Europe. The results show that the AVM is significantly more efficient while maintaining its accuracy for the dynamic response of the overall system.},

The converter has six branches, each one composed of full H-bridges cells connected in series to generate a multilevel voltage waveform, to share the blocking voltage of the power switches and to have fault tolerant operation.This paper presents a suitable control scheme and provides a discussion about the capabilities and limitations of the converter, the capacitor voltage balance control, the efficiency and the power loss mitigation at various operation points. Simulation results and power loss calculations are presented for a threephase 11 kV 16 MVA direct MMC with 10 H-bridge cells per branch. The direct MMC is simulated in a distribution network to demonstrate the features of the converter and control under various operation conditions, including grid faults.},

Among the existing multilevel converter topologies, the modular multilevel converter (MMC) provides the advantages of high modularity, availability, and high power quality. Moreover, the main advantage compared to cascaded multilevel converters is the lack of an input transformer which results in a reduction of cooling requirements, size, and cost. One of the drawbacks of this topology when used as an ac-ac converter is the input and output frequency components in the control loop, resulting in a more complex controller design. In this paper, a single-phase ac-ac MMC predictive control approach is proposed. The controller minimizes the input, output, and circulating current errors and balances the dc voltages. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed predictive control scheme.},

The quantities intended to evaluate integration level and volumetric utilization in power converters are introduced. Based on these values, a number of methods to increase the integration level are presented. A design process in the form of a flow chart that implements these methods in concrete design problems is presented. In this paper, the design process is applied to a dc/dc 42/14-V converter for automotive applications. Utilizing commercially available technologies that lend themselves to mass production this design process results in three packaging concepts, namely lead frame converter, printed circuit board embedded converter, and heat conductor converter. These concepts are then compared to a benchmark converter implemented in the conventional, discrete packaging technology. It is shown that by smart use of parts in the converter construction, the high values of integration level and high power densities can be achieved.},

In order to realize the large electrical energy savings potential enabled by power electronics suitable technological solutions at acceptable cost levels are needed. Moreover, public policy and public acceptance must play an increasingly important role. An effective way to quantify the value of power electronics is needed and it must be presented in such a way that it is understood and appreciated by policymakers. In this paper, energy payback time is shown to be a powerful tool for weighing the value of energy savings achieved by using power electronics versus the energy needed to manufacture the systems. A life cycle analysis of two power electronic converters and their parts is performed. The benefits of energy savings versus energy invested in manufacturing and end-of-life management of power converters is analyzed. It is shown that power electronics systems have considerably shorter energy payback time compared to other technologies.},

The circulating current references are obtained from the instantaneous values of the output current and modulation signal of the phase leg. Therefore, the determination of the amplitude and phase of the output current is not needed, which is a significant improvement compared to other methods such as those based on injecting specific harmonics in the circulating currents. Among the different methods studied in this paper, a new method is introduced, which is able to reduce the capacitor voltage ripples compared to the other methods. A closed-loop control is also proposed which is able to track the circulating current references. With the discussed methods, the average values of the capacitor voltages are maintained at their reference while the voltage ripples are kept low. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed and discussed methods.},

abstract = {In this paper, novel small-signal averaged models for dc–dc converters operating at variable switching frequency are de- rived. This is achieved by separately considering the on-time and the off-time of the switching period. The derivation is shown in detail for a synchronous buck converter and the model for a boost converter is also presented. The model for the buck converter is then used for the design of two digital feedback controllers, which exploit the additional insight in the converter dynamics. First, a digital multiloop PID controller is implemented, where the de- sign is based on loop-shaping of the proposed frequency-domain transfer functions. And second, the design and the implementation of a digital LQG state-feedback controller, based on the proposed time-domain state-space model, is presented for the sameconverter topology. Experimental results are given for the digital multiloop PID controller integrated on an application-specified integrated circuit in a 0.13µm CMOS technology, as well as for the state- feedback controller implemented on an FPGA. Tight output volt- age regulation and an excellent dynamic performance is achieved, as the dynamics of the converter under variable frequency opera- tion are considered during the design of both implementations.},

abstract = {This dissertation presents a comprehensive study of Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converters for Solid State Transformers (SSTs). The first contribution is to propose an ac-ac DAB converter as a single stage SST. The proposed converter topology consists of two active H-bridges and one high- frequency transformer. Output voltage can be regulated when input voltage changes by phase shift modulation. Power is transferred from the leading bridge to the lag- ging bridge. It analyzes the steady-state operation and the range of zero-voltage switching. It develops a switch commutation scheme for the ac-ac DAB converters. Simulation and experiment results of a scaled down prototype are provided to verify the theoretical analysis. The second contribution is to develop a full-order continuous-time averagemodel for dc-dc DAB converters. The transformer current in DAB converter is purely ac, making continuous-time modeling difficult. Instead, the proposed approach uses the dc terms and 1st order terms of transformer current and capacitor voltage as state variables. Singular perturbation analysis is performed to find the sufficient conditions to separate the dynamics of transformer current and capacitor voltage. Experimental results confirm that the proposed model predicts the small-signal frequency response more accurately. The third contribution addresses the controller design of a dc-dc DAB converter when driving a single-phase dc-ac inverter. It studies the effect of 120 Hz current generated by the single-phase inverter. The limitation of PI-controller is investigated. Two methods are proposed to reduce the voltage ripple at the output voltage of DAB converter. The first method helps the feedback loop with feedforward from inverter, while the second one adds an additional resonance controller to the feedback loop. Theoretical analysis, simulation and experiment results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

abstract = {A parallel hybrid modular multilevel converter (PHMMC) belongs to the class of modular multilevel converters, which have become potential candidates for high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission systems. Due to the circuit topology of a PHMMC, the dc bus voltage contains low-order harmonics and cannot be fully regulated at a constant dc voltage. The dc bus voltage, if not properly controlled, leads to improper power transfer and increases the magnitude of dc current ripple on the dc transmission line. This paper proposes a zero-sequence voltage injection (ZSVI)-based model predictive control (MPC) strategy to control the dc current/power flow and simultaneously minimize the dc current ripple. The proposed strategy takes advantage of a cost function minimization technique to determine and inject the optimal zero-sequence voltage components into the dc- bus voltage of a PHMMC system. This paper derives a discrete-time dynamic model of the dc transmission-line current and, correspondingly, develops a predictive model. The predictive model is used to inject the appropriate amount of zero-sequence voltage components to the dc bus reference voltage waveform. Compared with the existing triplen harmonics injection method, the proposed ZSVI-MPC strategy improves the performance of a PHMMC system in terms of minimization of the dc current/voltage ripple. Performance of the proposed strategy for a 21-level PHMMC-based HVDC station system is evaluated based on time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. The reported results demonstrate superior performance of the PHMMC-HVDC station operating based on the proposed ZSVI-MPC strategy, under various operating conditions, as opposed to the existing triplen harmonics injection method.},

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a potential candidate for medium/high-power applications, specifically for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems. One of the technical challenges associated with the control of an MMC is to carry out the submodule (SM) capacitor voltages balancing task without imposing any unnecessary switching transition among the SMs. This paper develops a general framework for the capacitor voltage balancing of an MMC. Based on the developed framework and with the objective of reducing the unnecessary switching transitions among the SMs, three capacitor voltage-balancing strategies are proposed and investigated: 1) a slow-rate balancing strategy based on the conventional sorting method; 2) a hybrid balancing strategy which combines a predictive method with the conventional sorting method; and 3) a fundamental-frequency balancing strategy. Performance of the proposed strategies for a point-to-point 21-level MMC-based HVDC system is evaluated based on time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. The reported study results demonstrate the capability and tradeoffs of the proposed strategies to reduce the number of switching transitions and, consequently, the MMC losses, under various conditions.},

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become the most promising converter technology for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems. However, similar to any other voltage-sourced converter-based HVDC system, MMC-HVDC systems with the half-bridge submodules (SMs) lack the capability of handling dc-side short-circuit faults, which are of severe concern for overhead transmission lines. In this paper, two new SM circuit configurations as well as a hybrid design methodology to embed the dc-fault-handling capability in the MMC-HVDC systems are proposed. By combining the features of various SM configurations, the dc-fault current path through the freewheeling diodes is eliminated and the dc-fault current is enforced to zero. Several MMC configurations based on the proposed hybrid design method and various SM circuits, that is, the half-bridge, the full-bridge, the clamp-double, and the five-level cross-connected SMs, as well as the newly proposed unipolar-voltage full-bridge and three-level cross-connected SMs, are investigated and compared in terms of the dc-fault-handing capability, semiconductor power losses, and component requirements. The studies are carried out based on time-domain simulation in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment for various SM configurations and dc-fault conditions. The reported study results demonstrate the proposed hybrid-designed MMC-HVDC system based on the combination of the half-bridge and the proposed SM circuits is the optimal design among all evaluated systems in terms of the dc-fault-handing capability, semiconductor power losses, and component requirements.},

In this paper, a simple and systematic procedure which can be implemented through a computer program is presented for realizing a specific class of multidimensional (M-D) complex digital filters. The proposed filter structures are derived from analog reference configurations comprising generalized immittance converters and resistors by making use of wave concept. These filters possess many salient properties such as low noise, low sensitivity and capability of realizing multiple transfer functions simultaneously which are inherited from the reference analog filters they are derived from. These features make them attractive for very large-scale integrated (VLSI) implementation. It is shown that the proposed filter structures can be obtained directly from the specified M-D discrete transfer function without the need for realizing any analog reference configuration.},

abstract = {—Historically, cascaded H-bridge, capacitor-clamped, and neutral point-clamped topologies have been used for medium-to high-voltage applications but the modular multilevel converter (M2LC) is becoming a popular alternative. However, in comparison to other topologies, control of the load current, which is inherently coupled with circulating currents, is more difficult in the M2LC topology. This paper proposes a modified M2LC topology that al-lows for decoupled control of circulating currents from the load current. Each arm of the modified topology comprises a plurality of half-bridge modules and one full-bridge module. The full-bridge module minimizes harmonic currents within the converter without affecting the load current. A state-space model, which is general-ized per arm with an N number of half-bridge modules and one full-bridge module, is presented to accurately predict the behavior of the proposed topology. Theoretical as well as experimental re-sults of a single-phase three-level 800-VA prototype converter are presented with a discussion to demonstrate the viability of both the proposed mathematical model and modified topology. A compar-ative investigation with respect to a conventional topology reveals that the proposed topology offers superior performance. Index Terms—Circulating currents, decoupled control, high-voltage direct current (HVDC), modular multilevel converter (M2LC), voltage balancing, voltage correcting module (VCM).},

The proposed MPDCC scheme maintains the load current within tight bounds around sinusoidal references and minimizes capacitor voltage variations and circulating currents. An internal prediction model of the M2LC is used to minimize the number of switching transitions for a given current ripple at steady-state while providing a fast current response during transient conditions.

However, the use of the latest low voltage power MOSFET generations and the continuously increasing range of switching frequencies have made it necessary to review this model to account for the parasitic inductances that it does not include. This paper presents a complete analytical switching loss model for power MOSFETs in low voltage switching converters that includes the most relevant parasitic elements. It clarifies the switching process, providing information about how these parasitics, especially the inductances, determine switching losses and hence the final converter efficiency. The analysis presented in this paper yields two different types of possible switching situations: capacitance-limited switching and inductance-limited switching. This paper shows that, while the piecewise linear model may be applied in the former, the proposed model is more accurate for the latter. Carefully-obtained experimental results, described in detail, support the analytical results presented.},

abstract = {This paper presents a power inverter tailored for low-power photovoltaic (PV) systems. The inverter features high reliability, thanks to a circuit topology that obviates aluminum electrolytic capacitors from the circuit. Moreover, all components, including logic and control, have been designed to exhibit high reliability at high temperatures. Three conversion stages form the power topology. First, a full bridge connected to a high-frequency transformer and a full-bridge rectifier amplifies the voltage of the PV panel to approximately 475 V. This stage is controlled by using a phase-shift pulsewidth-modulation controller that permits zero-voltage switching, thereby minimizing losses. Second, a buck converter is connected in series with the rectifier and is controlled by using current mode in order to shape the current injection into a rectified sine wave. Last, a full bridge is operated at line frequency to unfold the current injection. The amplification stage has a proportional compensator that maintains the voltage at the PV terminals constant. The current injection stage has a proportional-derivative compensator that controls the amplitude of the grid current so that the dc-link average voltage is maintained constant. Experimental results show that the peak efficiency of the system is 89{\{}{\%}{\}}, and the total current harmonic distortion is below 5{\{}{\%}{\}}. Finally, analyses show a designed lifetime of approximately ten years.},

Inherent in this type of construction are regulation, significant weight, losses, environmental concerns, and power quality issues. For the 21st century, a new kind of distribution transformer is proposed; one that can be made self-regulating, oil-free, and able to correct power quality problems. A power electronic transformer has been analyzed, simulated, prototyped, and tested. Results of this effort as well as the novel features of this new type of transformer are discussed herein},

abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid modular multilevel converter (MMC), which combines full-bridge submodules (FBSM) and half-bridge submodules (HBSM). Compared with the FBSM-based MMC, the proposed topology has the same dc fault blocking capability but uses fewer power devices hence has lower power losses. To increase power transmission capability of the proposed hybrid MMC, negative voltage states of the FBSMs are adopted to extend the output voltage range. The optimal ratio of FBSMs and HBSMs, and the number of FBSMs generating a negative voltage state are calculated to ensure successful dc fault blocking and capacitor voltage balancing. Equivalent circuits of each arm consisting of two individual voltage sources are proposed and two-stage selecting and sorting algorithms for ensuring capacitor voltage balancing are developed. Comparative studies for different circuit configurations show excellent performance balance for the proposed hybrid MMC, when considering dc fault blocking capability, power losses, and device utilization. Experimental results during normal operation and dc fault conditions demonstrate feasibility and validity the proposed hybrid MMC.},

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is one of the most potential converter topologies for high-power/voltage systems, specifically for high-voltage direct current (HVDC). One of the main technical challenges of an MMC is to eliminate/minimize the circulating currents of converter arms while the capacitor voltages are maintained balanced. This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) strategy that takes the advantage of a cost function minimization technique to eliminate the circulating currents and carry out the voltage balancing task of an MMC-based back-to-back HVDC system. A discrete-time mathematical model of the system is derived and a predictive model corresponding to the discrete-time model is developed. The predictive model is used to select the best switching states of each MMC unit based on evaluation and minimization a defined cost function associated with the control objectives of MMC units and the overall HVDC system. The proposed predictive control strategy: 1) enables control of real and reactive power of the HVDC system; 2) achieves capacitor voltage balancing of the MMC units; and 3) mitigates the circulating currents of the MMC units. Performance of the proposed MPC-based strategy for a five-level back-to-back MMC-HVDC is evaluated based on time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. The reported study results demonstrate a satisfactory response of the MMC-HVDC station operating based on the proposed MPC strategy, under various conditions.},

A single multi- winding high frequency transformer (HFT) interfaces different wind generators/photovoltaic arrays using many H-bridge con- verters and PWM inverters. The leakage inductance of the trans- former acts as the smoothening filter for the current through the HFT. With sinusoidal voltages and smooth currents through the transformer, there is significant reduction in transformer losses and also natural commutation of leakage energy is obtained.

abstract = {Product modularity has been discussed in engineering and management literature for over forty years. During this time span, definitions and views on the meaning of product modularity proliferated to the extent that it is difficult to understand the essential traits of the concept. While definitional ambiguity is often a byproduct of academic debate, it hinders the advancement of scientific knowledge as well. This paper aims to move a step forward toward a more precise definition of product modularity, by articulating a product system modularity construct in the domain of tangible, assembled artifacts. More precisely, the paper constitutively defines product modularity in terms of component separability and component combinability. An indirect operational definition for product modularity is then proposed by operationalizing component separability and component combinability. The proposed definition is finally related to other definitional perspectives synthesized by a literature review: component commonality, function binding, interface standardization, and loose coupling. In this way, the nomological network of the product modularity construct is laid out. Construct validation activities are left to further research},

abstract = {This paper provides an intensive discussion on analysis, simulation, and experiment of a back-to-back (BTB) system unifying two modular multilevel cascade converters based on double-star chopper cells (MMCCs-DSCCs). Each of the two DSCCs connected back-to-back consists of multiple cascaded chopper cells and a center-tapped inductor per leg. Low voltage steps bring significant reductions in harmonic voltage and current to the BTB system. Neither dc-link capacitor nor voltage sensor is required for regulating the dc-link voltage and controlling the dc-link current. A three-phase 200-V, 10-kW, 50-Hz downscaled BTB system with phase-shifted PWM is designed, constructed, and tested to verify its operating principles and performance. Analytical, simulated, and experimental results agree well with each other in steady and transient states. Experimental waveforms confirm the effectiveness of a self-starting/restarting procedure.},

abstract = {Input-series-output-series (ISOS) connected dc-dc converters enable the utilization of low-voltage rating switches in high-voltage-input and high-voltage-output applications that require galvanic isolation. To achieve input or output power balance among all the constituent modules, a general control strategy eliminating the use of input-voltage sharing (IVS) loops is proposed. The instability mechanism of independent output-voltage sharing control has been investigated by using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. From the same criterion, a stability design method for the proposed control strategy has been developed. Detailed comparison of the proposed control technique, voltage-mode IVS, and current-mode IVS control methods is made. In comparison, the proposed control strategy has the same performance compared with current mode IVS control. The control system design is simplified by avoiding mandatory IVS loops which are needed for IVS control. Both the steady-state and dynamic performance are improved with the proposed control strategy in comparison with voltage-mode IVS control. Using the proposed control strategy, excellent input and output power balance can be achieved for the ISOS connection during transient and steady-state conditions. The proposed control strategy performance is validated by experimental results of a 960-W ISOS system composed of three two-transistor forward dc-dc converters.},

abstract = {Moore's Law has been used to describe and predict the blossom of IC industries, so increasing the data density is clearly the ultimate goal of all technological development. If the power density of power electronics converters can be analogized to the data density of IC's, then power density is a critical indicator and inherent driving force to the development of power electronics. Increasing the power density while reducing or keeping the cost would allow power electronics to be used in more applications. One of the design challenges of the high-density power converter design is to have high-density magnetic components which are usually the most bulky parts in a converter. Increasing the switching frequency to shrink the passive component size is the biggest contribution towards increasing power density. However, two factors, losses and parasitics, loom and compromise the effect. Losses of high-frequency magnetic components are complicated due to the eddy current effect in magnetic cores and copper windings. Parasitics of magnetic components, including leakage inductances and winding capacitances, can significantly change converter behavior. Therefore, modeling loss and parasitic mechanism and control them for certain design are major challenges and need to be explored extensively. In this dissertation, the abovementioned issues of high-frequency transformers are explored, particularly in regards to high-power converter applications. Loss calculations accommodating resonant operating waveform and Litz wire windings are explored. Leakage inductance modeling for large-number-of-stand Litz wire windings is proposed. The optimal design procedure based on the models is developed.},

abstract = {Featuring modularity and high efficiency, the modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become a promising topology in high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission systems. However, its distributed capacitors lead to a more complicated startup process than that of a two-level converter. To fully understand this issue, the charging loops of a MMC rectifier and inverter during uncontrolled pre-charge period are analyzed in this paper, with special focus on the necessity of additional capacitor charging schemes. Moreover, the small signal model of the capacitor charging loop is first derived according to the internal dynamics of the MMC inverter. Based on this model, a novel startup strategy incorporating an averaging capacitor voltage loop and a feedforward control is proposed, capable of enhanced dynamic response and system stability without sacrificing voltage control precision. The design considerations of the control strategy are also given in detail. Simulation results from a back-to-back MMC (BTB-MMC) system supplying passive loads, and experimental results from a scaled-down MMC prototype are provided to support the theoretical analysis and proposed control scheme.},

abstract = {Multilevel current source converters are a smart choice for the high power applications with low voltage and high current requirements. This paper presents the detailed analysis of a current source modular multilevel converter (CSMMC) and its application as a STATCOM. Various properties of CSMMC are correlated with the voltage source modular multilevel converter (VSMMC). Submodule inductance selection method and a sorting based algorithm for inductor current balancing are proposed for CSMMC. The validity of the inductance selection method and the inductor current balancing algorithm are confirmed by the simulation of a three phase CSMMC using PSCAD/EMTDC. The carrier phase shifted sinusoidal pulse width modulation is used as the switching technique. The performance of a converter is analyzed with both interleaved and non-interleaved carrier signals for the upper and lower arms. Results show that CSMMCs and corresponding VSMMCs have analogous features. Hence, the development on VSMMCs can be used for reference to CSMMCs and vice versa. Furthermore, the control designs for CSMMC based STATCOM are presented and verified using simulations. The obtained results of the proposed STATCOM show that the steady state and transient performance of the system are quite satisfactory. This makes the CSMMC suitable for HVDC and FACTS applications.},

abstract = {The Modular Multilevel Converter is attracting the more and more interest in high power and high voltage applications. Highly redundant, each arm of the converter is made of a large number of identical sub-modules with inner storage capability allowing to reach very high voltage without DC link capacitor. The control of such a converter represents a challenge when it comes to the implementation of an MMC with a large number of sub-modules, namely in distributing the control tasks and handling the communicated values in-between controllers and sub-modules. This paper presents the details of an innovative sub-module selection method for the sub-module capacitor's voltage balancing within one arm of an MMC. 'The Tortoise and the Hare' sorting method shows very fast response, high reliability, and its implementation suits a large number of implemented sub-modules as for HVDC applications. The proposed sub-module capacitor's balancing method is validated on a three-phase 10kVA prototype with five sub-modules per arm.},

Despite the apparent simplicity of the circuit, the inherent dynamics of the converter and the balancing of the sub-module capacitor voltages impose high requirements on the control system, which can be implemented in quite different ways. To illustrate this, and to provide a guidance for future research on the subject, this paper presents an evaluation of four different control and modulation methods. The investigation is based on experiments on a down-scaled 10 kVA converter having 10 submodules per phase leg. The main items to be investigated are dynamics within the sub-modules, arm voltages and circulating currents. It is found that the suggested open-loop control method provides the fastest arm-voltage response and that the balancing approach based on a sorting algorithm is substantially faster and less complicated to implement than the method using a dedicated voltage controller for each sub-module.},

Specifications for MIPEC designing come out from many considerations concerning traction drive and reference driving cycle, on-board power source and storage unit characteristics. However, to date sizing and configuration of both storage units and on-board generators are directly related to traction drive and driving profile (i.e., vehicle performances and characteristics) and no relation with power electronic interface is considered during preliminary design. Then, power electronic interface is selected in order to fit traction drive requirements with power source and storage unit characteristics; as a consequence converter mode of operation lacks of optimization, as well dynamic behavior and efficiency cannot be maximized. In this paper, MIPEC design and power source and storage unit selection are achieved at the same project stage according to traction drive requirements.

abstract = {This paper presents design and control methods for fault-tolerant operations with redundant converter modules, one of the most prominent features in modular multilevel converter (MMC) topology. In fully implementing MMC functionalities, a nearest level control is applied as a low-switching modulation method. A dual sorting algorithm is newly proposed for effectively reducing the switching commutations of each power module as well as for voltage balancing control. Built upon these primary MMC topological and control features, its redundant operation is comprehensively investigated for fail-safe energy transfer. In particular, a novel spare process is proposed to handle an emergency situation when the number of faulty power modules exceeds the module redundancy. Since topological redundancy may cause the switching commutations of power modules in an arm to be unevenly distributed, a practical and effective mitigation measure is incorporated to keep the energy balance while avoiding the undesired switching stresses. Rigorous simulation studies for MMC and its application for high-voltage direct current are performed to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed spare process under normal and emergency conditions.},

Main circuit design and converter performance evaluation are always important issues to consider before installing a VSC-HVDC system. Investigation into a steady-state analysis method for an MMC-based VSC-HVDC system is necessary. This paper finds a circular interaction among the electrical quantities in an MMC. Through this circular interaction, a key equation can be established to solve the unknown circulating current. A new steady-state model is developed to simply and accurately describe the explicit analytical expressions for various voltage and current quantities in an MMC. The accuracy of the expressions is improved by the consideration of the circulating current when deriving all the analytical expressions. The model's simplicity is demonstrated by having only one key equation to solve. Based on the analytical expressions for the arm voltages, the equivalent circuits for MMC are proposed to improve the current understanding of the operation of MMC. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method are verified by comparing its results with the simulation and experimental results.},

Each phase leg of the MMC consists of two series connected strings of submodules, where each string of submodules is referred to as a phase arm. Based on analytically developed inter-arm power flow relations, a control methodology is proposed that provides fully independent control of each arm's real power flow, facilitating extreme levels of inter-arm power transfer. This eliminates the need for uniform integration of DER units across all submodules of the MMC. Among others, viable operating configurations are shown to include: DERs only integrated in upper (or lower) phase arms and DERs integrated only in the upper and lower phase arms of a single phase leg. Power balance is maintained internal to the MMC via dc and ac currents circulating within the converter without distorting input dc or output ac currents. To maximize conversion efficiency, a mechanism for minimizing the necessary circulating ac currents under any inter-arm power flow condition is also identified. Comprehensive simulation results validate both the developed model and controls.},

In both cases, long-series connected strings of batteries are required to efficientlymaintain the necessary dc-link voltage. Such configurations are susceptible to reliability issues, as shutdown of a battery string due to individual battery failure, overheating, or overcharging/discharging results in loss of a large fraction of ES capacity.To increase the reliability of anES system, shorter strings of batteries are preferable. In this study, the ES is subdivided into many banks of short-series strings, which are integrated into the submodules of amodular multilevel converter (MMC). To further enhance the reliability, the MMC should also be unaffected by an ES bank shutdown. This paper investigates the robustness of the MMC to ES bank failure by assessing the power balance between submodules when a subset of ES banks is not operational. The analysis concludes that asmany as 33{\{}{\%}{\}} of ES banks may be shut- down without affecting MMC power exchange with the grid, and is supported with both simulation and experimental results.

abstract = {The power conversion system for a battery-energy storage system typically employs a conventional voltage-source converter with battery strings directly connected to the dc bus. This system configuration presents several issues, such as limited efficiency of two-level converter systems and the limited reliability associated with the use of long battery strings. This paper examines three viable multilevel converter solutions for integrating battery energy storage that offer the potential for enhanced efficiency and reliability. These solutions are the modular multilevel converter (MMLC) with battery energy storage distributed into its submodules, the cascaded converter, and the MMLC with battery energy storage centralized on its dc link. The three systems are compared in terms of efficiency, reliability, and module redundancy. It is determined that the MMLC with distributed battery energy storage must operate differently from conventional MMLC systems. Its operation is therefore studied in detail and validated through simulation to demonstrate its suitability for distributed energy-storage integration. The analysis shows that the MMLC with distributed battery energy storage requires the largest number of semiconductor devices for a given power level; however, it also provides the most efficient, reliable, and versatile solution of energy-storage integration.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new single-phase wind energy inverter (WEI) with flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) capability is presented. The proposed inverter is placed between the wind turbine and the grid, same as a regular WEI, and is able to regulate active and reactive power transferred to the grid. This inverter is equipped with distribution static synchronous compensators option in order to control the power factor (PF) of the local feeder lines. Using the proposed inverter for small-to-medium-size wind applications will eliminate the use of capacitor banks as well as FACTS devices to control the PF of the distribution lines. The goal of this paper is to introduce new ways to increase the penetration of renewable energy systems into the distribution systems. This will encourage the utilities and customers to act not only as a consumer, but also as a supplier of energy. Moreover, using the new types of converters with FACTS capabilities will significantly reduce the total cost of the renewable energy application. In this paper, modular multilevel converter is used as the desired topology to meet all the requirements of a single-phase system such as compatibility with IEEE standards, total harmonic distortion (THD), efficiency, and total cost of the system. The proposed control strategy regulates the active and reactive power using power angle and modulation index, respectively. The function of the proposed inverter is to transfer active power to the grid as well as keeping the PF of the local power lines constant at a target PF regardless of the incoming active power from the wind turbine. The simulations for an 11-level inverter have been done in MATLABSimulink. To validate the simulation results, a scaled prototype model of the proposed inverter has been built and tested.},

This strategy, acting on the Vdc reference signal, allows the presence of multiple master converters in the DC grid. A five-terminal DC scheme, which connects onshore AC systems with offshore wind farms, has been developed in RT-Lab Simulator. Each sub-station (terminal) is equipped with a modular multilevel converter (MMC). The converters are either Vdc-Q controlled (master stations) or are P-Q (with droop control) or Vac-frequency regulated. The dynamic response of the system is observed after a converter outage to assess the validity of the proposed DC voltage control strategy.},

The essay first defines equity in a way that facilitates its assessment and monitoring and then summarizes evidence from existing research. Directions for developing policy strategies follow from these principles. The role of health services in influencing the distribution of health in populations is discussed in the special context of primary-care-oriented health systems that are, at the same time, more effective, more efficient, and more equity producing than is the case for specialist-dominated health systems.},

abstract = {Operational controls are designed to support the integration of wind and solar power within microgrids. An aggregated model of renewable wind and solar power generation forecast is proposed to support the quantification of the operational reserve for day-ahead and real-time scheduling. Then, a droop control for power electronic converters connected to battery storage is developed and tested. Compared with the existing droop controls, it is distinguished in that the droop curves are set as a function of the storage state-of-charge (SOC) and can become asymmetric. The adaptation of the slopes ensures that the power output supports the terminal voltage while at the same keeping the SOC within a target range of desired operational reserve. This is shown to maintain the equilibrium of the microgrid's real-time supply and demand. The controls are implemented for the special case of a dc microgrid that is vertically integrated within a high-rise host building of an urban area. Previously untapped wind and solar power are harvested on the roof and sides of a tower, thereby supporting delivery to electric vehicles on the ground. The microgrid vertically integrates with the host building without creating a large footprint.},

abstract = {Electrical power systems in future hybrid and fuel cell vehicles may employ three voltage [14V, 42 V, and high voltage (HV)] nets. These will be necessary to accommodate existing 14-V loads as well as efficiently handle new heavy loads at the 42-V net and a traction drive on the HV bus. A low-cost dc-dc converter was proposed for connecting the three voltage nets. It minimizes the number of switches and their associated gate driver components by using two half-bridges and a high-frequency transformer. Another salient feature is that the half bridge on the 42-V bus is also utilized to provide the 14-V bus by operating at duty ratios around an atypical value of 1/3. Moreover, it makes use of the parasitic capacitance of the switches and the transformer leakage inductance for soft switching. The use of half bridges makes the topology well suited for interleaved multiphase modular configurations as a means to increase the power level because the capacitor legs can be shared. This paper presents simulation and experimental results on an interleaved two-phase arrangement rated at 4.5kW. Also discussed are the benefits of operating with an atypical duty ratio on the transformer and a preferred multiphase configuration to minimize capacitor ripple currents. 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Systems based on the modular multilevel converter (MMC) concept can be used for a variety of applications including high voltage direct current transmission and flexible alternating current transmission system devices for power system control. In these applications, both the manufacturer and operator are keen to understand the stress conditions that the submodules are subject to. It is important to test for reliability of the submodules as a function of the design and control variables. This paper proposes a model assisted submodule testing scheme for an MMC that can be used in any of the possible applications. The submodules can be thoroughly tested individually before the complete MMC is built. Experimental measurements have shown the validity and accuracy of the proposed method with close attention given to the synchronization between the signals. The current (with dc bias and harmonic components) passing through the submodule, the switching sequence, and the capacitor voltage are shown to be identical to what the submodule would be subjected to when installed in a complete MMC. This test method is capable of facilitating research and development exercises through examining the electromagnetic and electrothermal characteristics.},

abstract = {The design of control circuit for a solar fed cascaded multilevel inverter to reduce the number of semiconductor switches is presented in this study. The design includes `binary', `trinary' and `modified multilevel connection' (MMC)-based topologies suitable for varying input sources from solar photovoltaic's (PV). In binary mode, 2Ns+1 - 1 output voltage levels are obtained where Ns is the number of individual inverters. This is achieved by digital logic functions which includes counters, flip-flops and logic gates. In trinary mode, 3Ns levels are achieved by corresponding look-up table. MMC intends design in both control and power circuits to provide corresponding output voltage levels by appropriate switching sequences. Hence to obtain a 15-level inverter, the conventional method requires 28 switches and in binary mode 12 switches are needed. In trinary mode with the same 12 switches, 27 levels can be obtained whereas in MMC only 7 switches are employed to achieve 15 levels. The advantage of these three designs is in the reduction of total harmonic distortion by increasing the levels. Simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink and comparisons were made. All the three topologies are experimentally investigated for a 3 kWp solar PV plant and power quality indices were measured.},

abstract = {A simple and cost-effective precharge method for modular multilevel converter (MMC) by using a low-voltage direct current (dc) source is proposed in this paper. The submodule (SM) capacitors in MMC are required to be precharged to their nominal voltage values at start-up to ensure MMC work normally. Conventional methods perform the precharging either through grid side or dc side by using costly high-voltage bypass breakers, charging resistors or a high-voltage dc source. Voltage of the high-voltage dc source must be equal to SM capacitor voltage and could be as high as thousands of volts. By contrast, the proposed method employs a very low voltage dc source on dc bus through a series-connected blocking diode, and requires no charging resistor and bypass breakers. It takes advantages of the existing power devices, arm inductors, and SM capacitors in MMC, and configures them into boost circuit for the precharging. The proposed method is simple and cost-effective. Moreover, the characteristics of the boost circuit render the proposed method flexible. For instance, the voltage selection of the dc source is flexible and not restricted to a fixed value. The SM capacitors can be charged in different groups. In addition, the method is applicable to different MMC SMs, including SM with different capacitor voltages. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulation and experiment.},

Since there are a number of submodules (SMs) in high-voltage applications of MMC and all SM voltages are required to be measured and sorted, if the uniform sampling frequency is not high enough, the SM will not be triggered as quickly as possible. Thus, the converter-output voltage levels and voltage harmonics will be affected. A method to systematically analyze the voltage harmonics is presented, considering the uniform sampling frequency. In order to select a proper sampling frequency, two critical values, which significantly influence the output voltage levels and voltage total harmonic distortions, are calculated.

The instantaneous power of the converter arm and phase unit indicates that there are zero-sequence double-line frequency components in the three-phase unit voltages when the ac system is under an unbalanced fault. Since the zero-sequence components cannot be offset by each other, they lead to the second-order harmonic in the dc voltage and dc current.

The crux of our proposal is showing that all the cell capacitor voltages converge exponentially fast to a common level; hence achieving natural balancing.

Power electronics appears to be a much more complex case, functioning as an enabling technology spanning an enormous range of power levels, functions and applications. Power electronics is also divided into many constituent technologies. Till now, the development of power electronics has been driven chiefly by internal semiconductor technology and converter circuit technology, approaching maturity in its internally set metrics, such as efficiency. This paper examines critically the fundamental functions found in electronic energy processing, the constituent technologies comprising power electronics, and the power electronics technology space in light of the internal driving philosophy of power electronics and its historical development. It is finally concluded that, although approaching the limits of its internal metrics indicates internal maturity, the external constituent technologies of packaging, manufacturing, electromagnetic and physical impact, and converter control technology still present remarkable opportunities for development. As power electronics is an enabling technology, its development, together with internal developments, such as wide bandgap semiconductors, will be driven externally by applications in the future.},

abstract = { Assemblies of power semiconductor switches and their associated drive circuit are at present available in modules. Upward into the multi-kilowatt range, mixed mode module construction is used. This incorporates monolithic, hybrid, surface mount and wirebond technology. However, a close examination of the applications in motor drives and power supplies indicates that there has been no dramatic volume reduction of the subsystem. The power semiconductor modules have shrunk the power switching part of the converter, but the bulk of the subsystem volume still comprises the associated control, sensing, electromagnetic power passives (inductors, transformers, capacitors) and interconnects. This paper addresses the improvement of power processing technology through advanced integration of power electronics. The goal of a subsystem in a module necessitates this advanced integration, incorporating active switching stages, EMI-filters and electromagnetic power passives into modules. The central philosophy of the technology development research in the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Power Electronic Systems is to advance the state of the art by providing the concept of integrated power electronics modules (IPEMs) for all these functions. The technology underpinning such an IPEM approach is discussed. The fundamental functions in electronic power processing, the materials, processes and integration approaches and future concepts are explained.},

The natural charge level mechanism of the capacitor voltages is also explained.

This paper analyzes such a converter structure under different operating modes. In order to eliminate the low frequency components of the sub-module output currents, the latter are interfaced to the batteries by means of non-isolated DC/DC converters. Control algorithms are developed for the balancing of the battery State of Charges and the respective gain limitations are established.

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become one of the most promising candidates for medium/highpower applications, specifically for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems. This paper proposes a control strategy for the MMC based on the Sum of Squares (SOS) decomposition method. A bilinear mathematical discrete model of the MMC is derived in the rotating reference frame by including the dynamics of ac-side currents, circulating currents, dc-side current and stored energy of the converter. The coordinates of the developed model are transformed to the origin and the steady-state operating point of the MMC is calculated based on the desired reference values of the states. A quadratic Lyapunov function is defined and by converting the Lyapunov difference inequality to an SOS problem, a stabilizing controller is designed. The designed controller not only guarantees the Lyapunov stability of the states, but also controls the external and internal dynamics of the MMC with only one controller, instead of using several PI controllers. To improve the MMC's region of operation, an optimization problem is formulated and solved, so the controller can stabilize the MMC from any initial operating point. Performance of the proposed strategy for a 20-level MMC is evaluated based on the time-domain simulation studies and is compared with the existing control methods.},

Abstract A multilevel modular DC–DC power conversion topology based on cascaded H-Bridge converters in a double II configuration is presented. The topology is intended to interconnect large power DC networks. A two level control hierarchy is used to regulate the DC voltage of each H-bridge module. At the top level, DC and circulating AC currents are used to control the total energy converter in all branches (both parallels and series) of each II arrange. At bottom level, the voltage balance of a converter branch, which comprises N H-bridge modules, is carried out by balancing (N-1) capacitor voltage deviations, with respect to the average capacitor voltage. The entire topology and control strategies are simulated in a PSIM environment. Simulation results with three H-bridge converters per branch are shown and preliminary experimental results with a low power prototype are also included.},

The influence of the WPP control method in the short-circuit behavior of the HVDC link has also been studied. Results show that the dynamics of the WPP contribution to pole-to-ground faults are slightly slower than those of the wind turbines current control loops. Therefore, the wind turbine front end converters can be used to reduce the peak and average value of the fault current in such a system.

For an automotive application, such as a DC-DC converter that interconnects the high voltage battery or ultra-capacitor in a hybrid electrical vehicle (HEV) or a fuel cell vehicle (FCV) to the DC-link, costs and failure rate are likewise of importance. Due to increasing requirements on multiple of these converter characteristics the comprehensive multi-objective optimization of the entire converter system gains importance. Thereto, this paper proposes an optimization method to explore the limits of power density as a function of the switching frequency and the number of phases of non-isolated bi-directional multi-phase DC-DC converters operated with soft-switching and silicon devices and hard-switched converters that take advantage of SiC devices. In addition, the optimization includes an algorithm to determine the chip size required for the semiconductor devices under consideration of the thermal characteristics and efficiency requirements. Based on detailed analytical volume, loss and cost models of the converter components as well as on measurements demonstrative results on the optimum converter designs are provided and evaluated comparatively for the different converter concepts.},

abstract = {Due to the rapid development of voltage source converter (VSC), the demands for HVDC cables have increased significantly. Although more than ten VSC-HVDC projects are under construction and many more are in operations globally, the testing criteria for HVDC XLPE cables are mainly referenced to test guideline TB 496 recommended by CIGRE. Due to the large stray capacitance of the VSC-HVDC cables, the switching impulse overvoltage stress of the cables is the main electrical parameter concerned, a unified overvoltage factor of 2.1 pu being generally accepted. However, the switching impulse overvoltage stress of a VSC-HVDC cable system depends on not only the VSC topology but also the cable parameters and the volt-ampere characteristics of the DC cable surge arresters used. This paper studies the switching impulse overvoltage stresses for the DC cable system of a symmetrical monopole VSC-HVDC transmission system using the modular multilevel converter (MMC) technology. The studies were performed according to the key technical parameters for a typical 1000 MW/320 kV VSC-HVDC transmission scheme, the XLPE DC cable links being assumed. The results show that a switching impulse overvoltage level of 2.3 pu should be applied during the type test of the overvoltage capability of the HVDC cables},

abstract = {An unbalance voltage between a positive pole and negative pole will exist for a long time in an ungrounded modular multilevel converter (MMC) HVDC transmission system. A zig-zag transformer has been proposed to construct an artificial neutral point and keep voltage balance between the positive pole and the negative pole. An efficient grounding system consists of the zig-zag transformer and the neutral grounding resistor. In this paper, the different impedances, including positive-, negative-, zero-sequence impedance, and dc current impedance, have been analyzed, respectively. Then, the computer simulations have been performed to evaluate the characteristic of the zig-zag transformer under normal voltage, zero-sequence voltage and unbalanced dc voltage, respectively. The simulation results show that the zig-zag transformer can effectively balance the unbalanced voltage in dc side of the MMC under different work conditions; the zero-sequence impedance is low and zero-sequence current is convenient for the detection of a single-phase fault; the power consumption of the neutral grounding resistor is of a light rating, and the cooling of the resistor is unnecessary. The method presented in this paper proves to be an efficient grounding method for the MMC-HVDC transmission system.},

The paper begins with a comprehensive summary and analysis on the prior-art modeling approaches of the MMC, where various models used for the MMC are discussed, and their limits in controlling the converter are shown. This is followed by the complete derivation of the proposed state-space switching model, whose mathematical derivation leverages simply on state variable transformations and Kirchhoff{\{}{\&}{\}}{\{}{\#}{\}}x2019;s Voltage Law (KVL) without losing any circuital characteristics of the converter.

With it, a switching-cycle control approach is proposed taking advantage of the developed state-space switching model. The new control scheme can greatly reduce the cell capacitance and arm inductance value, as well as enable the MMC to operate at any ac terminal frequency without affecting the voltage ripple of its capacitors. Simulation results are shown to validate the converter operations using the new control scheme.},

In this paper, a new MMC is proposed, and the structure and operating principle are analyzed. Owing to the cascaded basic cells without multiwinding transformer, the voltage balancing of floating capacitors must be considered. However, the voltage fluctuation also exists, and theoretical analysis indicates that the amplitude is inversely proportional to the fundamental frequency. This paper has proposed a voltage-fluctuation-suppression method which can reduce the amplitude of the voltage fluctuation in low-frequency region. It can also be used in motor driving with pump/blowerlike load at low frequency and improve the start-up performance significantly. A low-power three-phase five-level prototype is designed and built up to demonstrate the validity of this method.},

This paper describes a detailed design process for an HT SiC three-phase PWM rectifier that can operate at ambient temperatures above 100°C. SiC HT planar structure packaging is designed for the main semiconductor devices, and an edge-triggered HT gate drive is also proposed to drive the designed power module. The system is designed to make use of available HT components, including the passive components, silicon-on-insulator chips, and auxiliary components. Finally, a 1.4 kW lab prototype is tested in a harsh environment for verification.},

However, how to connect an offline MMC station into an operating MTDC system smoothly without expensive dc circuit breakers (CBs) presents a huge challenge. Making full use of the structural characteristics of MMC, the proposed strategy implements the smooth connection by sequential operations of the dc disconnectors (DSs) at the positive and negative polarities, without a need for changing system parameters or hardware. The charging circuits of MMC are studied fully after every operation of DSs, and a four-order state equation is built to explore the potential maximum surge current after closing the DSs. Case study and simulation are performed based on the PSCAD/EMTDC model of Nanao three-terminal MMC-HVDC system to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Besides easy operation and high reliability, the strategy neither influences the operating system nor increases any cost.},

While generalized voltage source converter models are usually utilized for multiterminal investigations, conclusions on transient DC grid behavior and on ACDC interactions during distorted AC grid conditions are hard to draw or limited in their significance. In this paper, a MMC based DC grid framework with a tripartite focus on internal converter, DC and AC grid control is presented. Besides an evaluation of the implemented MMC model that incorporates the available arm sum voltage, a decoupled AC and DC current system control concept suitable to handle unbalanced voltage conditions is derived for HVDC applications. Combined with wind farm arrays, this collocation allows a meaningful examination of hybrid ACDC structures and the implemented DC grid control methodologies. To provide proof of the universal applicability of this framework, simulations are carried out on a five terminal system.},

abstract = {Although many high-power voltage source converters are of three-phase three-wire type, there may also be other types of configuration with which tripplen harmonics in the ac voltage and/or current are of great concern. This paper analyzes the harmonic characteristic of the output voltage of modular multilevel converter (MMC) in cases where the third-order harmonic voltage and current are inevitable, such as in three-phase four-wire configurations. The interaction among the capacitor voltage, arm current, and the modulating signal will generate multiple harmonics in the output voltage, in which the third-order harmonic is the most dominant. The third-order harmonic in the MMC output voltage will cause excessive amount of third-order harmonic in the output current in grid-connected applications with three-phase four-wire configuration. Analytical expression for the output voltage is derived for open-loop case, considering both the fundamental-frequency reference signal and the circulating current-control signal in the modulating signals. A feedforward compensation (FFC) method is proposed for suppressing the influence of the third-order harmonic in the output voltage for grid-connected applications. Simulation and experimental results verified the correctness of the analysis and effectiveness of the proposed FFC method.},

abstract = {Considering the voltage difference between the neutral points of the DC side and the AC side, this study first establishes the differential mathematical model of the modular multilevel converter (MMC). Then, through the proposed successive approximation approach, the analytical expressions of the electrical quantities are derived, including the arm voltage and current, the output voltage and current, the capacitor voltage and current, the voltage difference between two neutral points, the instantaneous active and reactive power, the arm reactance voltage and the current of switching devices. The proposed successive approximation approach contains three main steps. In step 1, the preliminary analytical expressions of the MMC's electrical quantities based on the ideal step wave of the arm voltage with constant SM's capacitor voltage is deduced; step 2 is to derive the final analytical expressions of the MMC's electrical quantities according to the time-varying SM's capacitor voltage expression which is derived in the first step; and the convergence is analysed in step 3. A simulation model of the MMC is realised in PSCAD/EMTDC and the results show that the complete analytical model coincides well with the simulation results and has a higher accuracy than the traditional model.},

abstract = {Many commercial and military transport systems have fault diagnostic functions implemented to help protect the device when a severe fault occurs. However, most present systems do not contain prognostics capability which would allow operators to observe an unhealthy system component in its pre- fault condition. In industry applications, scheduled downtime can result in considerable cost avoidance. The next technology step is self-healing system components which observe not only potential problems, but can also take steps to continue operation under abnormal conditions - whether due to long-term normal wear-and-tear or sudden combat damage. In this paper, current and voltage information using the double-layer gate drive concept is fed to intelligent networks to identify the type of fault and its location. These intelligent networks are based on unsupervised and supervised learning networks (self-organizing maps and learning vector quantization networks respectively). The proposed concept allows the reconfiguration of the electric machinery system for continued normal operation of the machine. This paper presents an intelligent health monitoring and self-healing control strategy for a multi-phase multilevel motor drive under various types of faults.},

This paper proposes an improved scheme which uses the full-bridge submodules-based modular multilevel converters to replace the thyristor converters in pole 3, and the converters in pole 1 and 2 are also replaced by the modular multilevel converters based on half-bridge submodules. In order to obtain good performance among three poles, coordination control is proposed. This paper also proposes voltage-inverse control and a control strategy of keeping current zero in pole 3 to suppress overvoltage and to minimize the ground current in transition processes. The performance of the proposed tripole HVDC system is evaluated through PSCAD/EMTDC. Simulation results show that based on the control strategy, the tripole HVDC system can achieve satisfactory response characteristics in transition processes, maintain the balance of capacitor voltages, and minimize the ground current in the meantime.},

The AVM models are benchmarked by comparison with a detailed electromagnetic transient model of the grid, including a fully detailed MMC model. Analysis results show that the AVM is only effective as long as the capacitors are large enough to maintain nearly constant voltage across each MMC submodule. This paper also shows that previously developed MMC averaged models are not able to accurately simulate the transients under dc fault conditions. This paper introduces topology changes to a previously proposed averaged model that results in much improved simulation for such conditions. This paper also shows that the model can be used effectively to study HVDC grids with significant time savings.},

However, accurate modeling of MMC with a high level in PSCAD/EMTDC is extremely time-consuming and requires hardware. Based on the Kirchhoff's Law, an equivalent accelerated model for MMC is proposed. The essence of the new model is the partition of one large-scale admittance matrix into substantial small-scale matrices, which is mathematically demonstrated with the nodal analysis method. Finally, the detailed electromagnetic transient simulations are implemented for the comparisons of steady state and transient performances, and the results validate the proposed model.},

This paper presents a self-start control strategy for the C-MMC-based HVDC link. The equivalent charging circuit for the uncontrolled precharging stage is derived and the behaviors of the CDSM are investigated. In addition, the selection of the current-limiting resistor is described. To fully charge the capacitors in submodules, a simple grouping sequentially controlled charge (GSCC) method is proposed. This method makes the capacitors be charged group by group so that each capacitor can share sufficient stored energy. In particular, detailed startup procedures are designed for the HVDC link under two conditions, that is, connecting to active grids and supplying the passive network. The feasibility of the GSCC scheme under cell failure conditions is discussed. The validity of the proposed strategies is verified by PSCAD/EMTDC simulations.},

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become one of the most promising converter topologies for medium/high-power applications. As the MMC is structured based upon stacking up of a number of series-connected identical SubModules (SMs), to improve its fault tolerance and reliability, SM failure detection and location is of significant importance. In this paper, the impact of open-circuit switch failures of the SMs on the operation of the MMC is analyzed. Based on the analysis under SM failure conditions, two SM failure detection and location methods are proposed, i.e., a clustering algorithm (CA)- based method and a calculated capacitance (CC)-based method. In the proposed CA-based method, a pattern recognition-based fault diagnosis approach, which employs the clustering algorithm to detect and locate the faulty SMs with open-switch failures through identifying the pattern of two-dimensional trajectories of the SM characteristic variables, is developed. The proposed CC-based method is based on the calculation and comparison of a physical component parameter, i.e., the nominal SM capacitance, and is capable of failure detection, location, and classification within one stage. Performance of the proposed failure detection methods for an MMC system is evaluated based on time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. The reported study results demonstrate the capabilities of the two proposed methods in detecting and locating any SM failure under various conditions accurately and efficiently.},

abstract = {Nuclear fusion reactors, such as the tokamak in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, usually involve extremely sophisticated high-voltage power supply systems, which provide exciting research challenges. In the short term, the major challenges in power supplies of the ITER and other fusion reactors include the following: 1) fast current control of vertical stabilization (VS) coils and 2) dynamic compensation of reactive power and harmonics. In the long term, the power supply systems in fusion reactors provide opportunities for optimizations at both component and system levels. In this paper, modular multilevel converters ((MLCs)-L-2) are adopted to tackle the short-term challenges. Circuit structures, pulsewidth-modulation methods, and fault-tolerant operation strategies are presented. The configuration and control strategies of (MLC)-L-2 in VS coils are fully studied and verified with real-time simulations. Compared with existing circuit solutions in fusion reactors, the (MLC)-L-2-based circuits will have better dynamic response, higher reliability, smaller footprint, and reduced weight. As an outlook to the long-term developments of the fusion power supplies, comprehensive real-time simulations are also discussed. Furthermore, as the future development direction of power electronic devices, the wide band gap devices are discussed at the end of this paper.},

abstract = {A component level dc transformer is described in which no alternating currents or voltages are present. It operates by combining features of a homopolar motor and a homopolar generator, both dc devices, such that the output voltage of a dc power supply can be stepped up (or down) with a corresponding step down (or up) in the current. The basic theory for this device is developed, performance predictions are made, and the results from a small prototype are presented. Based on demonstrated technology in the literature, this dc transformer should be scalable to low megawatt levels, but it is more suited to high current than high voltage applications. Significant development would be required before it could achieve the kilovolt levels needed for dc power transmission.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the concept of convertible static transmission controller (CSTC) using modular transformer converter (MTC) as the building block. The MTC is a bidirectional back-to-back ac/ac power conversion unit and the CSTC is a versatile transmission controller asset for dynamic power flow control and contingency management of the transmission grid. The proposed CSTC with new functions has several advantages compared to existing flexible ac transmission system controllers. System modularity for manufacturers and utilities/system operators using standard high power electronic systems is one of the advantages of this structure. In this paper, algebraic models of the CSTC are derived in two different operation modes (series{\&}{\#}x2013;shunt and shunt{\&}{\#}x2013;shunt connecting configurations). The proposed algebraic models are used to define the reference values for the CSTC converters based on the desired operating points for the meshed power system, the power transformers in particular. The dynamic performance of the CSTC with the proposed control structures and algebraic models will be investigated based on the PSCAD simulation. To prove the CSTC as a transmission asset and to verify the control structure and algorithm, ultrahigh fidelity controller hardware-in-the-loop testing has been conducted and comparative results will be presented. Finally, lab-scale experimental results are reported on the dynamic performance of the MTC-based CSTC.},

abstract = {Power converter efficiency is always a hot topic for switch mode power supplies. Nowadays, high efficiency is required over a wide load range, e.g., 20{\{}{\%}{\}}, 50{\{}{\%}{\}} and 100{\{}{\%}{\}} load. Computer-aided design optimization is developed in this research work, to optimize off-line power converter efficiency from light load to full load. A two-stage optimization method to optimize power converter efficiency from light load to full load is proposed. The optimization procedure first breaks the converter design variables into many switching frequency loops. In each fixed switching frequency loop, the optimal designs for 20{\{}{\%}{\}}, 50{\{}{\%}{\}} and 100{\{}{\%}{\}} load are derived separately in the first stage, and an objective function using the optimization results in the first stage is formed in the second stage to consider optimizing efficiency at 20{\{}{\%}{\}}, 50{\{}{\%}{\}} and 100{\{}{\%}{\}} load. Component efficiency models are also established to serve as the objective functions of optimizations. Prototypes 400V to 12V/25A 300W two-FET forward converters are built to verify the optimization results.},

abstract = {In this paper, a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) operation scheme of the modular multilevel converter adopting clamp double submodules (CDSM-MMC) during a pole-to-pole dc fault is proposed. By analyzing the current paths of a CDSM, this paper proposes three new operation states of the CDSM, which allow the CDSM to provide bipolar voltages when the arm current that flows through it is negative. Through control of the CDSMs to operate in these new states along with the blocked state, the arms of the CDSM-MMC can operate alternately in two different modes, that is, the conducting mode and blocked mode even when the dc-link voltage drops to zero. Thus the CDSM-MMC is capable of working as a STATCOM during a dc fault. Moreover, a control strategy of the dc-fault STATCOM operation mode is designed to control the reactive power provided by the CDSM-MMC, to limit the dc fault current, and to reserve and balance the energies stored in capacitors. Simulation results conducted in PSCAD/EMTDC demonstrate the validity of the proposed STATCOM operation scheme and control strategy of the CDSM-MMC during a pole-to-pole dc fault.},

abstract = {Medium-voltage power conversion is generally favored for future large wind turbines, e.g., 10 MW, in terms of higher power density, reduced current level, associated losses, and cost of power cables, switchgears, etc. This paper has summarized a fundamental rule to construct multilevel modular high power converters for large wind turbine power conversion. Based on that, three potential multilevel modular high power converter topologies are derived and compared. The topology with a 10-kV generator, a modular power converter, and a multi-winding step-up transformer have been specifically investigated. The large dc-link capacitor (not reliable, high cost, large volume) required in the converter is identified as the key limitation of the system used for wind power conversion. The paper proposes to compensate the ripple power by the grid-side inverter of the multilevel modular converter, thus reducing the dc-link capacitor requirement. The paper has validated the effectiveness of proportional-integral-resonant controller for this purpose. Further, the thermal impact of the proposed ripple power compensation scheme on the converter device junction temperature and the transformer secondary windings has been analytically derived. The paper has also analytically revealed that the proposed ripple power compensation scheme will not affect the grid-side power quality, although there are low-frequency harmonics in the transformer secondary windings. Simulation results with a 10-MW, 10-kV system have validated the proposed converter topology and control strategy with reduced dc-link voltage ripple.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new component within the flexible ac-transmission system (FACTS) family, called distributed power-flow controller (DPFC). The DPFC is derived from the unified power-flow controller (UPFC). The DPFC can be considered as a UPFC with an eliminated common dc link. The active power exchange between the shunt and series converters, which is through the common dc link in the UPFC, is now through the transmission lines at the third-harmonic frequency. The DPFC employs the distributed FACTS (D-FACTS) concept, which is to use multiple small-size single-phase converters instead of the one large-size three-phase series converter in the UPFC. The large number of series converters provides redundancy, thereby increasing the system reliability. As the D-FACTS converters are single-phase and floating with respect to the ground, there is no high-voltage isolation required between the phases. Accordingly, the cost of the DPFC system is lower than the UPFC. The DPFC has the same control capability as the UPFC, which comprises the adjustment of the line impedance, the transmission angle, and the bus voltage. The principle and analysis of the DPFC are presented in this paper and the corresponding experimental results that are carried out on a scaled prototype are also shown.},

Unlike symmetric conditions, the fundamental ac current is not split equally between the upper and lower arms under asymmetric conditions and the dc and double-frequency components in the common-mode current also flow into the ac side. To solve these issues, a theoretical analysis of the effect of asymmetric conditions on MMC operation is carried out using equivalent circuits at different frequencies. Three control targets are then presented to enhance the operational performance. A control strategy providing the control of differential-mode current, common-mode current and power balance is designed.

This paper presents a modular multilevel dc–dc converter based on the standard boost converter topology but with the normal single switches replaced by a number of capacitor-clamped submodules. The converter is operated in resonant mode with resonance between submodule capacitors and the arm inductor. A phase-shifted switching arrangement is applied such that there is a constant number, i.e., N , of sub-modules supporting the high voltage at a time. In this oper-ation mode, the step-up ratio is dependent on the number of submodules and the inductor charging ratio. The converter exhibits scalability without using a transformer and is ca-pable of bidirectional power flow. An application example of a wind turbine interface with a 10 : 1 conversion ratio is demonstrated in simulation. The experimental verification of the concept using a lab-scale prototype is provided.

abstract = {Modular multilevel converters (MMCs) have become increasingly interesting in dc-dc applications, as there is a growing demand for dc-dc converters in high-voltage applications. Power electronics transformers can be used for high step-down ratio dc-dc power conversion, with high power rating and efficiency achieved. However, this arrangement requires a large number of high isolation voltage transformers and a complicated balancing control scheme. To provide a simple solution with inherent voltage balancing, this paper presents a new resonant MMC topology for dc-dc conversion. The proposed converter achieves high-voltage step-down ratio depending on the number of submodules. The converter also exhibits simplicity and scalability with no necessary requirement of high-voltage isolation transformers. By using phase-shift control, a much higher converter operating frequency is achieved compared to the switching frequency. Resonant conversion is achieved between the series inductor and submodule capacitors.

abstract = {This paper presents theoretical analysis of a network fault tolerant hybrid cascaded multilevel converter when operated as one unit using multilevel pulse width modulation. The analysis establishes the modulation index range where the voltage balance of the H-bridge floating capacitors of the hybrid converter is attainable independent of load power factors. To realize the established modulation range, a new modulation strategy is proposed that exploits third harmonic subtraction modification of the reference voltage in order to extend the regions around zero voltage crossing where the cells capacitor voltage balancing can be achieved, with a minimum number of cells; independent of load power factor. The significance of the proposed modulation strategy is that it permits increased utilization of dc link voltage independent of operating condition over an extended modulation linear range. Therefore this hybrid converter is applicable to real and reactive power applications, with a higher power density than existing multilevel converters. The validity of the theoretical analysis and proposed extended modulation index linear range are confirmed using simulations and experimentations. The presented analysis and proposed modulation linear range extension can be extended to a hybrid converter with a large number of series H-bridge cells.},

A general modelling method is proposed to develop the discrete-time average model. This full-order model takes into account the leakage inductance current and the resonant transition intervals in order to realise ZVS. Both the leakage inductance current and the resonant transition intervals are the key to accurately predict the dynamic behaviour of the converter. A control-to-output-voltage transfer function is derived for the dual active bridge DC-DC converter, which is taken as an example to illustrate the modelling procedure. Experimental results confirm that the new model correctly predicts the small-signal frequency response up to one-third of the switching frequency and is more accurate than the previously presented models.},

abstract = {Renewable-energy-based microgrids are a betterway of utilizing renewable power and reduce the usage of fossil fuels. Usage of energy storage becomes mandatory when such microgrids are used to supply quality power to the loads. Microgrids have two modes of operation, namely, grid-connected and islanding modes. During islanding mode, the main responsibility of the storage is to perform energy balance. During grid-connected mode, the goal is to prevent propagation of the renewable source intermittency and load fluctuations to the grid. Energy storage of a single type cannot perform all these jobs efficiently in a renewable powered microgrid. The intermittent nature of renewable energy sources like photovoltaic (PV) demands usage of storage with high en- ergy density. At the same time, quick fluctuation of load demands storage with high power density. This paper proposes a composite energy storage system (CESS) that contains both high energy den- sity storage battery and high power density storage ultracapacitor to meet the aforementioned requirements. The proposed power converter configuration and the energy management scheme can actively distribute the power demand among the different energy storages. Results are presented to show the feasibility of the pro- posed scheme.},

abstract = { A novel control scheme for improving the power efficiency of low-voltage dc-dc converters for battery-powered, portable applications is presented. In such applications, light-load efficiency is crucial for extending battery life, since mobile devices operate in stand-by mode for most of the time. The proposed technique adaptively reduces the inductor current ripple with decreasing load current while soft switching the converter to also reduce switching losses, thereby significantly improving light-load efficiency and therefore extending the operation life of battery-powered devices. A load-dependent, mode-hopping strategy is employed to maintain high efficiency over a wide load range. Hysteretic (sliding-mode) control with user programmable hysteresis is implemented to adaptively regulate the current ripple and therefore optimize conduction and switching losses. Experimental results show that for a 1-A, 5- to 1.8-V buck regulator, the proposed technique achieved 5{\{}{\%}{\}} power efficiency improvement (from 72{\{}{\%}{\}} to 77{\{}{\%}{\}}) at 100 mA of load current and a 1.5{\{}{\%}{\}} improvement (from 84{\{}{\%}{\}} to 85.5{\{}{\%}{\}}) at 300 mA, which constitute light-load efficiency improvements, when compared to the best reported, state-of-the-art techniques. As a result, the battery life in a typical digital signal processing microprocessor application is improved by 7{\{}{\%}{\}}, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed solution.},

abstract = {As the popularity of electric vehicles increases, the demand for more power can increase more rapidly than our ability to install additional generating capacity. In the long term we expect that the supply and demand will become balanced. However, in the interim the rate at which electric vehicles can be deployed will depend on our ability to charge these vehicles without inconveniencing their owners. In this paper, we investigate using fairness mechanisms to distribute power to electric vehicles on a smart grid. We assume that during peak demand there is insufficient power to charge all the vehicles simultaneously. In each five minute interval of time we select a subset of the vehicles to charge, based upon information about the vehicles. We evaluate the selection mechanisms using published data on the current demand for electric power as a function of time of day, current driving habits for commuting, and the current rates at which electric vehicles can be charged on home outlets. We found that conventional selection strategies, such as first-come-first-served or round robin, may delay a significant fraction of the vehicles by more than two hours, even when the total available power over the course of a day is two or three times the power required by the vehicles. However, a selection mechanism that minimizes the maximum delay can reduce the delays to a few minutes, even when the capacity available for charging electric vehicles exceeds their requirements by as little as 5{\%}.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the contents of submodule voltage ripples, circulating currents, and internal converter voltage in modular multilevel converters (MMCs) theoretically. The operation of MMCs is studied under asymmetry of the upper and lower arm, as well as the unbalanced ac system. In three-phase MMCs, the analysis shows that the second harmonic circulating currents will be asymmetric under an unbalanced ac system and can be decomposed into positive-, negative- and zero-sequence parts. The positive- and negative-sequence components affect neither the ac side nor the dc side of MMCs while the zero-sequence components will flow into the dc side, aggravating the power fluctuations of the dc side. In order to solve this problem, a new controller based on the instantaneous power theory and proportional-resonant scheme is designed. Simulations with a detailed switching model on the PSCAD/EMTDC platform verify the theoretical analysis, and demonstrate that the proposed controller eliminates the active power fluctuations and suppresses the harmonic circulating currents as well.},

@article{McMurray1971,
abstract = {The electronic transformer is a device which behaves in the same manner as a conventional power transformer in that it steps voltage levels up or down while providing isolation and can accommodate load current of any power factor. It contains thyristor power switches which convert the low-frequency (dc to 400-Hz) voltage wave to a high-frequency (in the order of 10 000 Hz) wave. A comparatively small magnetic transformer then provides the voltage level transformation and isolation functions. Similar thyristor power switches then reconstruct the original low-frequency wave at the desired output voltage level. This device can incorporate additional features not found in a conventional transformer, such as current limiting and current interruption. The theory of operation is presented and confirmed by experimental data.},
